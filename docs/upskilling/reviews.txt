I rate this course 5 stars. The instructor's explanations are exceptionally clear, and they have crafted several engaging hands-on projects for us to tackle. Learning a new skill or framework can be daunting, but the instructor's positive encouragement spurred me on to complete the course. I gained a wealth of knowledge and never once felt bored throughout the learning process.

It's good and I am able understand the concepts clearly. But only problem is Q&A, no proper response if we stuck some where, which I think can be improved.

The first part of the course is great, 5 stars. The second part, where he builds an app, becomes too complex too quickly. You can easily lose track of what he is doing, and the focus shifts from understanding the building blocks of langchain to integrating everything in this structure of the app. Also, there are a lot of problems when integrating to the various tools he uses in the second part, together with the deprecated modules from langchain. Not a good experience in this second part, so I rated 3 stars.

Content is very well explained. Good for anyone trying to understand how langchain works and build Gen AI apps.

The langchain library has been updated since the content was recorded, but all the concepts taught are still valid.

OpenAI APIs are used in the course. If you use the free tier, there's a rate limit of 3 requests per min which may cause errors when running chains which exceed this limit e.g. when using agents. Free tier also doesn't have access to GPT-4.

Very nice and important tutorial, with excellent information that is well structured by a very knowledgeable teacher.

The only complaint was that there was maybe too much put into explaining with graphics rather than coding, which made the course a bit hard to follow sometimes. But the quality of the content ultimately shone through.

El curso esta muy bien explicado, el profesor es genial, el gran problema es que con los ultimos cambios de langchain, hay muchas cosas obsoletas (deprecated) por ejemplo toda la seccion de streaming podria ser saltada con la version 0.1.19. con una actualizada seria un 5.

As always, Stephen has a great amount of information to share. Langchain is evolving quickly and newer versions do not support the suggested implementation anymore. So you will be forced to use older versions.

ChatGPT does not have a free tier anymore and you will need to spend $5 ( you will use less than $0.15 of that ) to be able to follow along.

I was initially running Ollama locally and trying to have everything talk locally, but that is basically impossible in the last project since a lot of that is pre setup.

I still think that this is a really good use of my time and as always I walk away having learned a lot of new things.

Great course for anyone looking to leverage LLMs in their application. The instructer is great at explaining the various features of langchain using a real example. The course covers the simplest way langchain can be used to how is implemented in a very relatable production project while covering many areas of consideration when it comes to programatically interacting with an LLM.

The course was extremely detailed and covers the basics of Langchain very well.

Somewhere around the 2nd half of the course, the focus shifted to building the web app rather than Langchain. A major chunk of the course is not about Langchain itself but about the app that is being built.

I recently wrapped up the 'LangChain using ChatGPT' course led by Stephen and wow, what a fantastic journey! Stephen has this cool way of using Miro boards to simplify complex topics into neat, easy-to-digest visual diagrams. It really resonated with me and made the concepts stick. Even as someone who’s been coding in Python for a while, I found the course's clear progression from basic to advanced topics super helpful—it’s given me some nifty tricks to streamline my day-to-day tasks. If you’re looking to up your game using LangChain and any LLM, including ChatGTP, and make your workflow more efficient, I can’t recommend this course enough. It’s a game-changer!

This course is excellent. It is well organized and provides solutions to production level challenges. Not only did I learn a lot about LangChain, I picked up some more advanced knowledge on Python in general.

I like how the instructor also focuses on the user experience in addition to the backend. So, you are not just learning about LangChain. You are learning about how to use LangChain in a real-world app providing a good user experience.

This course by far is the best course I have taken on Udemy, and I have taken a lot of courses. Stephen always starts by laying the foundational theory behind what he is going to go over with a clear and conscious way. He always makes sure the student has a grasp of the theory prior to delving in the code/technical part of the course. Then when going through the code development process, he always makes sure to explain every line of code and tie it back to the theoretical part of the course. His use of diagrams is exceptional, very clear and well put-together diagrams that will help the student understand the whole process.

Stephen uses lots of diagrams and practical examples in his courses. Thus far, this is no different. With so many persons offering training on a subject, I always look to see if Stephen has a course on it before making my decision.

One difficulty I've had was the issue of deprecated libraries for the eCommerce app in section #6. I was unable to code along because the errors were a bit overwhelming, but I did follow everything he did. It would help if there was an updated collection of the code files for us to review and evaluate on our own - as opposed to him having to recreate the videos accordingly.

Above all else, Stephen has the skill to decipher when to use certain tools like Langchain and when not to, and opt for his own solution. This provides ease of learning, best practices, and new software learning opportunities.

I had taken two other (shorter) courses in this same topic on udemy and they left me really wanting more. Those courses are essentially code walk-throughs. They had the feel of a developer trying to act as a teacher. I was lost when I had to go out and try to apply what I had learned because there was very little taught about the theory.

With this course, you have the approach of a teacher trying to teach theory. There are lots of diagrams and chapters spent on detailing what happens under the hood. I like when instructor have us assemble code piece-by-piece, including starting small and re-factoring as needed.

A word of warning: if you are somewhat new to python (as I am), eventually it becomes difficult to see the trees from the forest. This is not a complaint - Stephen tells us up front that this is not a class on Python development and that he assembled some code to save us time. I don't know if this is possible, but it might have been nice to spend a little more time on how the various pieces fit together. I suspect that will be one of the things that I'll do next for myself as I try to better understand what I got out of this course. The important thing is that Stephen has given me a MUCH, MUCH better understanding of Lanchain that I had coming in. I can't recommend this course enough.

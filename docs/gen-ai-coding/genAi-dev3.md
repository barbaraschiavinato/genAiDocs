GenAi for Developer Productivity - Part-3
=========================================



One of the important impact of GenAI is on the developer productivity - following areas are immediatly impacted by GenAI:

-   Code Completion
-   Code Generation
-   Code Optimization
-   Code Translation
-   Code Verification

1.  Code Completion: Many generative AI tools offer code completion features that can help you write code faster and more accurately. These tools use GenAI algorithms to suggest code snippets based on the context of the code you're writing, reducing the amount of time you spend on writing boilerplate code and hunting down syntax errors. Example -  [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)  and  [Tabline](https://www.tabnine.com/)
2.  Code Generation: Generative AI tools can also generate code snippets or entire functions based on your specifications. These tools are trained on large datasets of code and can generate code that is syntactically and semantically correct. Example -  [Code T5](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5)  and  [Mutable AI](https://mutable.ai./)
3.  Code Optimization: Generative AI tools can also help you optimize your code for performance and efficiency. These tools can analyze your code and suggest changes that can improve its speed, memory usage, and other performance metrics.  [Amazon codeguru](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/)  and  [Deepcode](https://snyk.io/platform/deepcode-ai/)
4.  Code Translation: Generative AI tools can also translate code from one programming language to another, making it easier to work with code written in different languages. These tools use machine learning algorithms to analyze the syntax and structure of code and generate equivalent code in a different language.Example  [Transcoder](https://github.com/facebookresearch/TransCoder)  and  [Codewhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/).
5.  Code Verification: Generative AI tools can also help you test your code more efficiently and effectively. These tools can generate test cases and test data that can help you identify bugs and other issues in your code. Example  [Diffblue](https://www.diffblue.com/)  and  [Mabl](https://www.mabl.com/)

There are many IDE(Integrated development environment) / Plugins / code generators are empowered by GenAi and are broadly classfied as :

-   Closed source GenAI for Programming
-   Open source GenAI for programming.

Closed source GenAI for Programming:

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

-   Developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI, GitHub Copilot functions as a  virtual pair programmer. It suggests whole lines or blocks of code as you type, going beyond simple auto-completion.
-   Trained on public code repositories, it understands multiple programming languages and adapts to each developer's unique style.
-   Predictive code generation: Accelerates coding by suggesting entire lines or blocks of code.
-   Multilingual capability: Understands a vast range of programming languages.

[Replit GhostWriter](https://replit.com/learn/intro-to-ghostwriter)

-   Seamlessly integrated with the Replit online code editor, GhostWriter  auto-fills code in real-time  as you type.
-   Real-time code completion: Reduces writing time and minimizes syntax errors.

[Cody by SourceGraph](https://meetcody.ai/)

-   Cody is a AI coding assistant that writes, fixes, and maintains your code. Cody understands your entire codebase by leveraging the power of  [Code Graph](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cody/core-concepts/code-graph)  to gather context, which assists you in writing accurate code.

[Codeium's](https://codeium.com/OpenAI)

-   Generative code can save you time and help you ship products faster. Available on all of your favorite IDEs.
-   70+â€¯Languages supported and 40+ editors supported.

[Blackbox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/)

-   Available in more than 20 programming languages, BLACKBOX AI code search was created so that developers could find the best code fragments to use when building amazing products. Integrations with various leading IDEs include VS Code and Github Codespaces. Jupyter Notebook, Paperspace, and many more. It is not necessary to leave your coding environment in order to search for a specific function.
-   Blackbox allows you to select the code from any video and then simply copy it into your text editor.

[StarCoder](https://www.huggingface.co/blog/starcode)

-   StarCoderBase and StarCoder are Large Language Models (Code LLMs), trained on permissively-licensed data from GitHub. This includes data from 80+ programming language, Git commits and issues, Jupyter Notebooks, and Git commits.
-   StarCoderBase is a model that outperforms other open Code LLMs in popular programming benchmarks.
-   StarCoder models are able to process more input with a context length over 8,000 tokens than any other open LLM. This allows for a variety of interesting applications.

[IBM watsonx Code Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-code-assistant)

-   [IBM watsonx Code Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-code-assistant)  helps developers write code using AI-generated recommendations, no matter their experience level. Developers can make requests in plain language or use existing source code to generate code for targeted use cases.
-   Out-of-the-box, watsonx Code Assistant provides pre-trained models based on specific programming languages to ensure trust and efficiency for accurate code generation.

Open Source GenAI for Programming:

[CodeLalama](https://codellama.dev/about)  and  [Falcon](https://falcons.ai/)  were prominent one used specific to the Open Source models. As of writing the article many new models like  [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)  is on the spot light competing with openAI chatGPT for programming as well.

It is interesting to see how the programming as such will be disrupted in the coming years. what is your opinion? do you know or heared any other GenAI tool which is optimizing the programming? do share your thought happy to understand your perspective.

# 11. SQL Query

## Prompt

Write an SQL query to select the top 10 highest earning employees from a table named 'Employees' that includes columns for 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary'.

## Results


### Amazon Q

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will:

1. Select the 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary' columns from the 'Employees' table.

1. Order the results by the 'salary' column in descending order, so the highest salaries are first.

1. Limit the results to the top 10 rows.

The key points are:

- The `ORDER BY salary DESC` clause sorts the results by the 'salary' column in descending order, so the highest salaries are first.

- The `LIMIT 10` clause limits the results to the top 10 rows.

This will return the 10 employees with the highest salaries, along with their 'employee_id' and 'name'.


### GitHub Copilot


```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will select the 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary' columns from the 'Employees' table, order the results in descending order by the 'salary' column (highest to lowest), and limit the results to the top 10.

### Axet Gaia

To select the top 10 highest earning employees from a table named 'Employees' that includes columns for 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary', you can use the following SQLite query:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query selects the 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary' columns from the 'Employees' table. It then orders the result set in descending order based on the 'salary' column. Finally, it limits the result set to the top 10 rows.


### ChatGpt 4

Here is an SQL query that selects the top 10 highest earning employees from a table named `Employees`. This table includes columns for `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`. The query sorts the employees by their salary in descending order and limits the results to the top 10:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Breakdown of the SQL Query**

1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary` to be retrieved from the `Employees` table.

2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates that the data should be fetched from the `Employees` table.

3. **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts the results by the `salary` column in descending order (`DESC`), which ensures that the employees with the highest salaries are listed first.

4. **LIMIT Clause**: Restricts the output to only the top 10 rows, which corresponds to the top 10 highest earning employees.

This query will effectively retrieve the top 10 highest paid employees, showing their ID, name, and salary. Make sure your database supports the `LIMIT` clause, as SQL syntax can vary slightly between systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others. For instance, in SQL Server, you would use `SELECT TOP 10` instead of `LIMIT 10`.

### Meta.ai

Here is the SQL query to select the top 10 highest earning employees:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's how the query works:

- `SELECT *` selects all columns (`employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`) from the Employees table.
- `ORDER BY salary DESC` sorts the results in descending order based on the `salary` column, so the highest earners come first.
- `LIMIT 10` restricts the output to the top 10 results, so we only get the 10 highest earning employees.
  
This query assumes that the salary column is of a numeric data type (such as INT or DECIMAL) and that you want to include all columns in the output. If you only want to include specific columns, you can replace * with the column names, like this:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will give you the `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary` of the top 10 highest earning employees.

### Gemini


```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT:** This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the table. Here, we select `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`.
2. **FROM:** This clause specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data. Here, we use `Employees`.
3. **ORDER BY salary DESC:** This clause sorts the results in descending order based on the `salary` column. This ensures the highest earners appear first.
4. **LIMIT 10:** This clause limits the number of rows returned to the top 10 results.

This query retrieves the `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary` for the top 10 employees with the highest salaries in the `Employees` table.

## Analysis

### Amazon Q

     SELECT employee_id, name, salary
     FROM Employees
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Reiterates the same effective SQL query, ensuring the correctness of the solution. Mentions compatibility with SQLite, which can be useful for users working in various environments.
   - **Cons**: Similar to the previous solutions, there are no specific drawbacks since the SQL command provided is standard and widely applicable.

### ChatGPT 4
   - **Pros**: Provides a thorough explanation of each SQL clause used in the query, enhancing understanding for learners or less experienced users.
   - **Cons**: The detailed explanation may be unnecessary for more experienced SQL users, making the solution seem verbose.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, name, salary

   - **Cons**: Using `SELECT *` is generally discouraged in production environments due to efficiency concerns, especially in tables with many columns.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM Employees
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```

### Gemini
   - **Pros**: Accurately reproduces the required SQL query, ensuring that it captures the top 10 highest earning employees effectively.

## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **ChatGPT 4** stands out as the most instructive, providing detailed explanations that not only fulfill the query's requirements but also enhance the user's understanding of SQL operations. This is particularly valuable for learners or those new to SQL.

**Worst Implementation**: While there is no inherently poor implementation, the **Meta.ai** solution might be considered less optimal due to the use of `SELECT *`. This approach can lead to inefficiencies, particularly in larger databases or tables with many columns where specifying necessary columns could improve performance.

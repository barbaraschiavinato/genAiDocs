# Requirements best practices

1. **Focus on User Needs and Pain Points**: User stories should be centered around the needs, goals, and experiences of the end-users. Consider not only the positive outcomes but also potential pain points or challenges users may encounter.

2. **Use the "As a... I want to... So that..." Format**: Follow the standard user story format, which consists of three parts: the role of the user ("As a..."), the action or functionality they want ("I want to..."), and the reason or benefit for wanting it ("So that..."). This format helps maintain clarity and context for both positive and negative scenarios.

3. **Keep Stories Independent and Atomic**: Each user story should represent a single, independent unit of functionality that can be implemented and delivered separately. Include both positive and negative scenarios within a single user story when applicable, ensuring completeness and comprehensiveness.

4. **Write Stories from the User's Perspective**: Frame user stories in terms of what the user wants to accomplish or achieve. Include negative scenarios that highlight potential errors, difficulties, or unexpected behavior users may encounter during their interactions with the system.

5. **Include Acceptance Criteria for Positive and Negative Scenarios**: Clearly define acceptance criteria for each user story to outline the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete and ready for delivery. Specify acceptance criteria for both positive outcomes and negative scenarios, ensuring that the system behaves appropriately in error conditions.

6. **Estimate Story Size and Complexity**: Use story points or other estimation techniques to estimate the size and complexity of each user story relative to others. Consider the impact of both positive and negative scenarios on the overall complexity of the story when estimating.

7. **Collaborate with Stakeholders**: Involve stakeholders, including users, product owners, developers, and testers, in the process of creating user stories. Collaborative refinement sessions can help identify both positive and negative scenarios, ensuring that user stories are well-defined, feasible, and aligned with project objectives.

8. **Prioritize Mitigation of Negative Scenarios**: Prioritize user stories and tasks related to handling negative scenarios to ensure that they receive appropriate attention during development. Addressing potential error conditions early in the development process helps mitigate risks and improve the overall reliability of the system.

9. **Test Positive and Negative Scenarios During Validation**: During user story validation and testing, include test cases that cover both positive and negative scenarios to verify that the system behaves as expected in all conditions. This ensures that the system provides a positive user experience and handles errors gracefully.

10. **Iteratively Refine and Improve Error Handling**: Continuously refine and improve error handling based on feedback from testing and real-world usage. Use insights from user feedback, error logs, and monitoring to identify and address recurring issues or pain points encountered by users.

# common-problems

# Common Problems

## Technical Challenges

### Validity Interpretation
One significant challenge with generative AI tools is the need for developers to interpret the validity of the AI-generated outputs. Developers must possess a solid understanding of the code and context to discern whether the AI suggestions are accurate, efficient, and appropriate for the task at hand. This responsibility can add an additional cognitive load, as developers must validate the correctness and relevance of the AI-generated code before integrating it into their projects.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="8 9"
// AI-generated code to perform arithmetic operations
function performOperations(a, b) {
    return [a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b];
}

// Developer must ensure the function correctly handles edge cases like division by zero
const [sum, difference, product, quotient] = performOperations(10, 0);
console.log(sum, difference, product, quotient); // Output: 10, 10, 0, Infinity
// The developer needs to modify the code to handle division by zero appropriately

```

- **Impact:** 5
- **Risk:** Developers need to critically assess AI outputs, adding cognitive load and risk of integrating faulty code.
- **Mitigation:** Enhance developer training to better interpret and validate AI-generated code.

### Generating Inaccurate Responses
Generative AI tools sometimes provide answers even when they don't have sufficient information or understanding to provide a correct response. This can lead to misleading or incorrect code suggestions, which developers must carefully scrutinize and validate.

**Example**
```js
// AI-generated code to parse JSON from a string
function parseJsonString(jsonString) {
    try {
        // Incorrect use of eval instead of JSON.parse
        return eval('(' + jsonString + ')');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to parse JSON:', error);
        return null;
    }
}

// Correct approach should use JSON.parse
const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
console.log(parseJsonString(jsonString)); // Might incorrectly parse or fail
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** Can lead to incorrect functionality and bugs that may be difficult to diagnose and fix.
- **Mitigation:** Always review and test AI-generated code thoroughly before integrating it into the project.

### Old Training Data
Currently, all generative AI tools rely on outdated library versions, consistently yielding results that reflect older standards. This issue becomes particularly pronounced with rapidly evolving libraries, such as LangChain, or when the latest versions of these libraries conflict with other recommended libraries.

**Example**
```python hl_lines="7"
# AI-generated code using an outdated method from the pandas library
import pandas as pd

def load_and_process_data(filepath):
    # Supposing the AI was trained on data suggesting the use of the 'as_matrix()' method which has been deprecated and removed in later versions of pandas.
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    matrix = data.as_matrix()  # This will raise an AttributeError in pandas versions >= 1.0

    # The correct modern method is 'to_numpy()' since 'as_matrix()' was deprecated.
    return matrix

# Usage example that would fail if pandas >= 1.0 is used
filepath = 'path_to_data.csv'
load_and_process_data(filepath)
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Results in outdated or deprecated code, requiring extra effort for updates and fixes.
- **Mitigation:** Continuously update AI models with the latest training data and encourage developers to verify code against current documentation.


### Data Training Errors
Generative AI models, like those behind the tools mentioned, are trained on large datasets composed of text from the internet, code repositories, and other sources. If there is incorrect or speculative information circulating within these training sources, the AI might learn and subsequently reproduce these inaccuracies. For instance, if there were discussions or incorrect documentation examples online that mistakenly mentioned such a provider, the AI could adopt this as factual.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="4"
// AI-generated code to make a network request using fetch
function fetchData(url) {
    fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.jsonData())  // Incorrect usage due to training error
        .then(data => console.log(data))
        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}

// Correct usage should be response.json() not response.jsonData()
fetchData('https://api.example.com/data');
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** AI may perpetuate inaccuracies from its training data, leading to incorrect implementations.
- **Mitigation:** Use multiple sources of training data and implement validation steps to catch common errors.


### Autocompletion and Assumptions
These tools often generate suggestions based on patterns or partial inputs they have observed in their training data. If the training data included many instances of similar library import patterns (like `next-auth/providers/google` or `next-auth/providers/facebook`), the model might automatically suggest a similar pattern for Microsoft, assuming a consistency that doesn’t actually exist in the library’s offerings.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="2"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import MicrosoftProvider from "next-auth/providers/microsoft" // this library doesn't exist
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Assumptions based on patterns can suggest non-existent or incorrect libraries, causing confusion and errors.
- **Mitigation:** Validate AI-suggested libraries and code snippets against official documentation.


### Lack of Real-Time Validation
Unlike human developers who might check the existence or updates of libraries and their modules in real-time by consulting the official documentation or trying out the code, AI tools operate based on the information up to the point they were last trained. They don’t have the capability to verify current library documentation or check for real-time existence unless they are explicitly programmed to do so or are integrated with systems that allow such validation.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="5"
// AI-generated code to use the escape() function, which is deprecated
function secureParameters(params) {
    // Using escape() to encode URL parameters
   
    return escape(params);  // AI does not validate that escape() is deprecated and should not be used for URL encoding
}

console.log(secureParameters("name=John Doe&age=30"));
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** AI tools do not validate current library versions or availability, leading to potential runtime issues.
- **Mitigation:** Implement real-time validation mechanisms or cross-check suggestions with up-to-date resources.


### Generalization from Existing Knowledge
AI models are excellent at pattern recognition and might generalize from existing knowledge to fill in gaps when specific details are requested. This can lead them to generate plausible-sounding but ultimately incorrect information, especially in fields like software development where the ecosystem changes rapidly.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="3"
// AI-generated code to handle drag events on a canvas element
function setupCanvas(canvas) {
    canvas.onmousedown = function(event) { // AI assumes that dragging starts similarly to how it would on a desktop interface element
        console.log('Mouse down event on canvas');
        
        startDragging(event);
    };

    canvas.ondragstart = function(event) {
        // Prevent the default dragging for canvas to allow custom drag functionality
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log('Attempt to drag on canvas');
    };
}

// Usage of the canvas setup
const myCanvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
setupCanvas(myCanvas);
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Generalizations may lead to plausible but incorrect solutions, affecting the reliability of generated code.
- **Mitigation:** Encourage developers to critically evaluate AI-generated code and adjust it as necessary.

### No Error Checking
In their current state, most generative AI tools don’t have an error-checking mechanism. They can suggest code based on patterns and likelihoods, but they don’t execute the code to see if it works or validates against current libraries or frameworks. 

**Example**
```js hl_lines="4 9"
// AI-generated code to fetch user data from an API
function fetchUserData(userId) {
    fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)
        .then(response => response.json())  // Converts response to JSON without checking for response.ok
        .then(data => {
            console.log("User data retrieved:", data);
            // Process the data further
        })
        .catch(error => { // Generic catch block might catch fetch errors, but does not handle HTTP errors like 404 or 500
            console.log("An error occurred:", error);
        });
}

// Usage example
fetchUserData(123);
```

- **Impact:** 5
- **Risk:** Lack of built-in validation means AI suggestions can introduce serious bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation:** Incorporate automated testing and static analysis tools to validate AI-generated code.

### Precision in Prompting
To achieve accurate and useful results from generative AI tools, developers must craft precise and detailed prompts. Without clear and specific input, the AI may produce generic or irrelevant suggestions, making it crucial for developers to effectively communicate their requirements.

**Example**
```js

// Vague prompt might yield less useful results
const vaguePromptResult = generateFunction1("handle input");

// Result from imprecise prompt
function generateFunction1(input) {
    return input;
}

const precisePromptResult = generateFunction2("validate and sanitize user input for a registration form, ensuring email format and password strength");


// Result from precise prompt
function generateFunction2(input) {
    let errors = [];

    if (!input.email.match(/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/)) {
        errors.push("Invalid email format");
    }

    if (input.password.length < 8) {
        errors.push("Password must be at least 8 characters long");
    }

    if (!input.password.match(/[A-Z]/)) {
        errors.push("Password must contain at least one uppercase letter");
    }

    if (!input.password.match(/[a-z]/)) {
        errors.push("Password must contain at least one lowercase letter");
    }

    if (!input.password.match(/[0-9]/)) {
        errors.push("Password must contain at least one number");
    }

    if (!input.password.match(/[\W_]/)) {
        errors.push("Password must contain at least one special character");
    }

    return {
        valid: errors.length === 0,
        errors: errors
    };
}

```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** Vague prompts lead to less useful outputs, requiring developers to spend more time refining prompts and results.
- **Mitigation:** Provide guidelines and training on crafting precise prompts for AI tools.


### Context Limitations
Many AI models, especially those based on transformers like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), have a limit on the number of tokens (pieces of code, which could be keywords, variables, values, syntax characters, etc.) they can consider at one time. For instance, models like GPT-3 have a token limit that might prevent them from considering an entire long script in a single prompt. This truncation can lead to losing important context that is necessary for understanding or fixing parts of the code that appear beyond these limits.

**Example**

```js
// Long script with multiple functionalities
function longScript() {
    function partOne() {
        console.log("Part One");
        // ... more code
    }

    function partTwo() {
        console.log("Part Two");
        // ... more code
    }

    function partThree() {
        console.log("Part Three");
        // ... more code
    }

    partOne();
    partTwo();
    partThree();
}

// AI may struggle to process and fix this entire script in one go
longScript();
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Token limits and context truncation can lead to incomplete understanding and ineffective code suggestions.
- **Mitigation:** Break down long code into smaller, manageable segments for AI processing.

### Complexity and Dependencies
Long code often involves complex structures and dependencies within the codebase. AI might struggle to maintain an understanding of these relationships, especially if it cannot view all related segments simultaneously due to token limitations or due to its inherent limitations in understanding deeply nested or interconnected logic. Moreover, when not all connected files are available for analysis, the AI's ability to accurately comprehend and interact with the project's full architecture is further compromised. Missing files can lead to inaccurate code suggestions, misunderstandings of the project’s overall structure, and incorrect handling of dependencies. This fragmented view prevents AI from providing effective refactoring recommendations and can result in suggestions that do not align well with the actual needs or functionalities of the complete system. For optimal results, it's crucial to ensure that AI tools have access to the entire codebase, including all associated configurations and dependencies, allowing them to provide more reliable and coherent advice and modifications.

**Example**

```js
// Complex code with dependencies on other files
import { helperFunction } from './helper.js';

function mainFunction(data) {
    if (!data) {
        console.error('No data provided');
        return;
    }

    const result = helperFunction(data);
    console.log('Result:', result);
}

// AI might not be able to analyze helperFunction due to its location in another file
mainFunction({ key: 'value' });
```

- **Impact:** 5
- **Risk:** AI may struggle with complex interdependencies, leading to incomplete or incorrect refactoring suggestions
- **Mitigation:** Ensure AI tools have access to the entire codebase and its dependencies for better context.


### Error Propagation
In long codebases, an error in one part can have cascading effects on other parts. AI tools might identify and attempt to fix a local error but may not perceive its implications on the rest of the codebase, potentially leading to incomplete or incorrect fixes.

**Example**

```js
// Error in one function affecting another
function functionOne() {
    const importantValue = null;
    return importantValue.length;  // This will cause an error
}

function functionTwo() {
    try {
        functionOne();
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('Caught an error:', error.message);
    }
    console.log('Function Two completed');
}

// AI might fix functionOne without understanding its impact on functionTwo
functionTwo();
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** Local fixes by AI may overlook broader implications, causing cascading issues in the codebase.
- **Mitigation:** Perform comprehensive testing and code reviews after applying AI-generated fixes.


### Performance and Efficiency
Processing very long pieces of code requires more computational resources and time. AI systems may require simplification or breaking down the code into smaller segments to handle them effectively, which can complicate the fix process and introduce new errors or overlook issues.

**Example**

```js
// Long function causing performance issues
function longRunningFunction(data) {
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < data[i].length; j++) {
            result += data[i][j];
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// AI might struggle with optimizing this function without breaking it into smaller parts
const data = Array(1000).fill(Array(1000).fill(1));
console.log(longRunningFunction(data));

```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Processing long code can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, potentially introducing inefficiencies.
- **Mitigation:** Optimize code segments before submitting them to AI tools for processing.


### Semantic Understanding
While AI has made significant strides in syntactic understanding and can correct syntax errors or conform to coding standards, its semantic understanding — the "meaning" behind code blocks or the intent of the programmer — is still not as robust. This can lead to suggestions that syntactically make sense but semantically do not achieve what the original code intended, especially in complex, lengthy codes.

**Example**

```js
// AI-generated code with correct syntax but wrong logic
function calculateDiscount(price, discount) {
    // AI suggests multiplying price by discount percentage
    return price * discount / 100;  // Incorrect logic
}

const price = 100;
const discount = 20;  // Expecting a $20 discount
console.log(calculateDiscount(price, discount));  // Output: 20, should be 80
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** AI's limited semantic understanding can lead to syntactically correct but logically flawed code.
- **Mitigation:** Enhance AI training with contextually rich datasets and encourage developers to review logic thoroughly.

### Integration Challenges

## Coding Practices

### Ambiguously Named Functions
This example involves a function with a name that does not clearly indicate its purpose, which may confuse the AI about its intended functionality.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="1"
function processData(data) {
    // Intentionally vague and possibly misleading function name
    return data.split("").reverse().join("");
}

// Example usage that might not be clear to the AI
console.log(processData("hello"));
```

- **Impact:** 2
- **Risk:** Misleading function names can confuse AI and developers, but the impact is relatively low compared to other issues.
- **Mitigation:** Adopt clear and consistent naming conventions in the codebase.

### Nested Callbacks with Complex Logic
Deeply nested callbacks can lead to confusing code, often referred to as "callback hell", which can be challenging for AI tools to navigate or optimize effectively.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="7"
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("First level");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Second level");
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Third level - now things get tricky!");
            // Add more nested logic that could confuse the AI
        }, 1000);
    }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Complex nested callbacks can be difficult for AI to optimize, leading to potential errors or inefficiencies.
- **Mitigation:** Refactor nested callbacks into simpler, more maintainable structures.

### Misleading Variable Names
Using variable names that do not correspond to their content or purpose can lead to suggestions that do not make sense.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="1 2"
let apple = "banana";
let banana = "apple";

function eat(fruit) {
    console.log("Eating " + fruit);
}

// The AI might not understand the swap and provide incorrect suggestions
eat(banana);
eat(apple);
```

- **Impact:** 2 
- **Risk:** Incorrect variable names can lead to AI making incorrect suggestions, but the overall impact is lower.
- **Mitigation:** Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.

### Overly Complicated Boolean Logic
Complex boolean expressions can be difficult for AI to simplify or even understand properly, potentially leading to incorrect simplifications.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="3"
const a = true, b = false, c = true, d = false;

if ((a && b) || (!c || d) || (b && !d) || (a || !c)) {
    console.log("Passed");
} else {
    console.log("Failed");
}
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Complex boolean expressions can be misinterpreted by AI, leading to incorrect simplifications.
- **Mitigation:** Simplify boolean expressions and add comments to clarify their purpose.

### Advanced Mathematical Computations
Mathematical algorithms, especially those involving recursive or complex operations, can be challenging for AI tools to generate correctly without errors.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="2"
function calculateComplexFormula(x, y) {
    return Math.sin(x) / (Math.cos(y) * Math.tan(x + y));
}

console.log(calculateComplexFormula(0.5, 1.2));
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** Complex algorithms are challenging for AI to generate correctly, potentially introducing subtle errors.
- **Mitigation:** Verify AI-generated mathematical computations with domain experts.

### Uncommon or Deprecated Features
Code that relies on outdated or rarely used JavaScript features or APIs might not be well-supported by the AI's training data.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="4"
var oldStyleVar = "I'm old style!";

with (Math) {
    let result = sqrt(pow(oldStyleVar.length, 2));
    console.log(result);
}
```

- **Impact:** 2
- **Risk:** Use of outdated features can be suggested by AI, leading to compatibility issues.
- **Mitigation:** Review and update AI-generated code to align with current standards and best practices.

### Bias in Generated Code
Generative AI models may inadvertently learn and replicate biases present in their training datasets. This can lead to biased or skewed code suggestions, particularly in scenarios where code interacts with diverse datasets or user inputs.

**Example**
```js hl_lines="3 4"
// Example of biased AI-generated code
function filterJobApplications(applicants) {
    return applicants.filter(applicant => applicant.yearsOfExperience >= 5); 
    // Implicit bias: This code assumes years of experience is a fair measure of a candidate's worth, potentially discriminating against younger talent or those with different career paths.
}
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** AI models can inadvertently replicate biases from their training data, leading to skewed suggestions.
- **Mitigation:** Use diverse and representative training datasets and implement bias detection mechanisms.

### Dependency on Specific Coding Styles
AI tools often generate code that conforms to the styles and conventions they were most frequently exposed to during training. This can lead to a lack of diversity in coding approaches and potentially limit the adoption of newer or alternative coding practices.

**Example**
```js
// Example where AI follows a specific coding style
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;  // AI prefers concise functions, possibly ignoring contexts where more detailed functions with error handling are appropriate.
}
```

- **Impact:** 3
- **Risk:** AI tools may generate code that conforms to the styles they were most frequently exposed to, limiting diversity.
- **Mitigation:** Encourage adherence to a common coding style guide across the development team.



### Handling Ambiguous or Incomplete Requirements
AI's performance can degrade when faced with vague or partial requirements, often generating code that does not fully address the intended functionality.

**Example**
```js
// Example of AI-generated code from incomplete requirements
function processUserInput(input) {
    // AI-generated code assuming 'input' is always a string
    return input.trim();
    // What if 'input' is null, undefined, or an object? The AI did not handle these cases.
}
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** Vague or partial requirements can lead to incomplete or incorrect code generation by AI.
- **Mitigation:** Ensure requirements are well-defined and detailed before using AI tools.

### Version Compatibility Issues
AI-generated code might not always account for the specific versions of languages or libraries, leading to suggestions that may not be compatible with a developer's current environment.

**Example**
```js
// Example of version compatibility issue
Array.prototype.flat ? array.flat() : array.reduce((acc, val) => acc.concat(val), []);
// AI suggests using 'Array.flat', which isn't supported in older JavaScript environments without a polyfill.
```

- **Impact:** 4
- **Risk:** AI-generated code might not always account for specific versions, leading to compatibility issues.
- **Mitigation:** Validate code compatibility with the project's environment and dependencies.

### Security Risks in Suggested Code
AI might generate code that contains security vulnerabilities, especially if it has been trained on codebases that include insecure coding practices.

**Example**
```js
// Example of insecure AI-generated code
function storeUserData(userData) {
    localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData));
    // Storing sensitive data in local storage is vulnerable to XSS attacks.
}
```

- **Impact:** 5
- **Risk:** AI might generate insecure code, introducing vulnerabilities into the software.
- **Mitigation:** Perform thorough security reviews and use automated security analysis tools.

## Infrastructure Issues

# 1-fetch-data

# 1. Fetch Data from an API

## Prompt

Write a JavaScript function using the Fetch API to get JSON data from a placeholder service and log it to the console. This will test how the tools handle API requests and asynchronous operations and provide an example of use and its test.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```js

async function fetchAndLogJsonData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching and logging JSON data:', error);
  }
}

fetchAndLogJsonData();


```

This function first uses the `fetch()` function to make a GET request to the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1` endpoint, which returns a placeholder JSON object. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the response before continuing.

The `response.json()` method is then called to parse the response body as JSON data, and the resulting data object is logged to the console using `console.log()`.

If an error occurs during the fetch or JSON parsing, the `catch` block will handle the error and log it to the console using `console.error()`.

To test this function, you can simply call the `fetchAndLogJsonData()` function in your code, and it will fetch the JSON data and log it to the console.

Please note that I have not included any URLs in the response, as per the instructions. If you need to reference the placeholder service URL, you can use the information provided in the web resources section.

### GitHub Copilot

Here's a simple JavaScript function that uses the Fetch API to get JSON data from a placeholder service and logs it to the console:

```js
async function fetchData(url) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

// Usage
fetchData('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
```

This function, `fetchData`, takes a URL as an argument. It uses the `fetch` function to make a request to that URL. The `fetch` function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. This Response is then converted to JSON using the `json` method, which also returns a Promise. The resulting data is then logged to the console.

If any error occurs during this process, it is caught and logged to the console.


### Axet Gaia

```js

// Define the function to fetch and log JSON data
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

// Call the function to fetch and log JSON data
fetchData();

```

**Explanation**


- We define an `async` function called `fetchData` that uses the `await` keyword to handle asynchronous operations.
- Inside the function, we use the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the specified URL (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`).
- We then use the `json` method of the response object to parse the response as JSON.
- Finally, we log the parsed JSON data to the console using `console.log`.
- If any error occurs during the fetch or parsing process, we catch it and log the error to the console using `console.error`.
- We call the `fetchData` function to execute the code and fetch the JSON data.

This code follows best practices for JavaScript by using `async/await` to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and concise way. It also handles errors gracefully using `try/catch` blocks.


### ChatGpt 4

Below is a simple example of a JavaScript function using the Fetch API to get JSON data from a placeholder service, specifically `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`, which is a popular service for testing API interactions. This function fetches data from a typical resource like a list of posts and logs the results to the console. Additionally, I will provide a simple way to test this function in your JavaScript environment.

**JavaScript Function to Fetch Data**

```js
async function fetchData() {
    const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';  // URL to fetch data from
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);  // Make the API request
        if (!response.ok) {  // Check if the request was successful
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const data = await response.json();  // Parse JSON data
        console.log(data);  // Log data to the console
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);  // Log errors if any
    }
}

// Call the function to fetch data
fetchData();
```

**Testing the Function**

To test this function, you can run it in any JavaScript environment that supports the Fetch API, such as modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) or Node.js with a fetch polyfill. Here's a simple example of how you might test this function within a web browser environment:

1. **Open your browser**: Open your favorite browser that supports modern JavaScript features.
2. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on macOS) to open developer tools.
3. **Go to the Console tab**: Click on the "Console" tab in the developer tools window.
4. **Paste and run the function**: Copy the `fetchData` function code provided above and paste it into the console, then press Enter. The function will automatically run.
5. **View the output**: Observe the output logged to the console. It should display an array of posts fetched from the placeholder service.

This simple test will demonstrate the function's ability to make API requests, handle asynchronous operations, parse JSON data, and manage errors. By inspecting the output, you can verify that the data is being retrieved and displayed correctly, ensuring that the function behaves as expected.


### Meta.ai

Here is a simple JavaScript function that uses the `Fetch API` to get JSON data from a placeholder service and log it to the console:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

This function uses the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the JSON placeholder service, which returns a response object. The `json()` method is then used to parse the response data as JSON. Finally, the data is logged to the console using `console.log()`.

You can test this function by running it in a JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or a Node.js environment. It should log an array of post objects to the console.

Note: The `async/await` syntax is used to handle the asynchronous nature of the Fetch API. The `try/catch` block is used to handle any errors that may occur during the request.


### Gemini


```javascript
async function fetchData(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Error fetching data: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`async function fetchData(url)`:** This declares an asynchronous function named `fetchData` that takes a URL as input.
2. **`try...catch`:** This block handles potential errors during the fetch operation.
3. **`const response = await fetch(url);`:** This line uses the `fetch` API to retrieve data from the provided URL. The `await` keyword ensures the function waits for the response before proceeding.
4. **`if (!response.ok) { ... }`:** This checks if the response status code indicates success (usually 200-299 range). If not, it throws an error.
5. **`const data = await response.json();`:** This converts the response body (assuming JSON format) into a JavaScript object using `response.json()`. Again, `await` is used for waiting.
6. **`console.log(data);`:** If everything goes well, the fetched JSON data is logged to the console.
7. **`catch (error) { ... }`:** This block catches any errors that might occur during the process and logs them to the console.

**Testing the Function:**

Here's an example of how to test the function using a placeholder service like JSONPlaceholder ([https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)):

```javascript
const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1';

fetchData(url)
  .then(() => console.log("Data fetched successfully!"))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching data:", error));
```

This code calls `fetchData` with the specified URL. It then uses `.then` and `.catch` methods on the returned promise to handle successful and failed fetches respectively.

**Note:** Remember to replace the placeholder URL with the actual API endpoint you want to use.

       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error:', error);
       }
     }
     fetchData();
     ```

# 2-dom-manipulation

# 2. DOM Manipulation

## Prompt

Create a script that listens for a button click event and changes the text of a div element. This example will help you see how the tools suggest handling DOM events and provide an example of use and its test.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Button Click Event Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
  <div id="myDiv">This text will change</div>

  <script>
    // Get references to the button and div elements
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
    const div = document.getElementById('myDiv');

    // Add a click event listener to the button
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
      // Change the text of the div element
      div.textContent = 'The text has been changed!';
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>

```

In this example, we first get references to the button and div elements using their respective IDs. We then add a click event listener to the button using the `addEventListener()` method.

When the button is clicked, the event listener function is executed, which changes the text content of the div element using the `textContent` property.

To test this script, you can open the HTML file in a web browser and click the "Click me" button. You should see the text inside the div element change to "The text has been changed!".

This example demonstrates how to handle a DOM event (in this case, a button click) and update the content of an HTML element accordingly. The Fetch API example I provided earlier showed how to make an asynchronous API request and handle the response, which are also common tasks in web development.




### GitHub Copilot

Here's a simple JavaScript code snippet that listens for a button click event and changes the text of a div element:

```js
document.querySelector('#myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    document.querySelector('#myDiv').textContent = 'Button was clicked!';
});
```

In this code, `document.querySelector('#myButton')` selects the button with the id of 'myButton'. The `addEventListener` method is then called on this button to listen for 'click' events. When a 'click' event occurs, the function passed to `addEventListener` is called. This function selects the div with the id of 'myDiv' and changes its text content to 'Button was clicked!'.

To test this code, you can create a simple HTML file with a button and a div:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button id="myButton">Click me</button>

<div id="myDiv">Initial text</div>

<script src="yourScript.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

Replace "yourScript.js" with the path to the JavaScript file containing the above script. When you open this HTML file in a web browser and click the button, the text of the div should change.

### Axet Gaia


```js
// Get the button element
const button = document.querySelector('button');

// Get the div element
const div = document.querySelector('div');

// Add a click event listener to the button
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Change the text of the div element
  div.textContent = 'New text';
});
```

**Explanation**


- We use `document.querySelector` to select the button and div elements from the DOM.
- We add a click event listener to the button using `addEventListener`.
- Inside the event listener, we change the text of the div element by setting its `textContent` property to the desired value.

This code follows best practices by:

- Using `querySelector` instead of `getElementById` to select elements, which allows for more flexibility in selecting elements.
- Separating the logic for selecting elements and adding event listeners into separate steps, which improves code readability and maintainability.
- Using arrow function syntax for the event listener, which provides a more concise and modern way of defining functions.
- Using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` to set the text of the div element, which is more secure and prevents potential security vulnerabilities.

### ChatGpt 4

Here's a simple JavaScript script that demonstrates how to listen for a button click event and then changes the text of a div element based on that event. This example will provide insight into handling DOM events in JavaScript and can serve as a good test for code completion tools like GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer.

**JavaScript Script for DOM Manipulation**

First, let's define the HTML structure for the button and the div:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Button Click Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="changeTextButton">Change Text</button>
    <div id="displayText">Original Text</div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, create the JavaScript file named `script.js` that will contain the code to handle the button click:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    const button = document.getElementById('changeTextButton');
    const textDiv = document.getElementById('displayText');

    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        textDiv.textContent = 'Text changed after button click!';
    });
});
```

**Explanation**

- **HTML Setup**: The HTML contains a simple button with an ID `changeTextButton` and a div element with an ID `displayText` where the text will be displayed.
- **JavaScript Behavior**: The script waits until the DOM is fully loaded (`DOMContentLoaded` event). It then selects the button and the div using their IDs. An event listener is added to the button such that when it is clicked, the text content of the div changes to "Text changed after button click!".

**Testing the Script**

To test this script, follow these steps:

1. **Create HTML and JavaScript Files**: Save the HTML code in a file named `index.html` and the JavaScript code in a file named `script.js` in the same directory.
2. **Open the HTML File in a Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. You should see a button labeled "Change Text" and a div displaying "Original Text".
3. **Interact with the Button**: Click on the button. The text inside the div should change to "Text changed after button click!" indicating that the script is working correctly.

This test verifies that the event listener is properly set up and that it correctly modifies the DOM in response to user interactions. It's a fundamental example of using JavaScript for interactive web pages.

### Meta.ai

Here is a simple script that listens for a button click event and changes the text of a div element:
HTML
// HTML
<button id="myButton">Click me!</button>
<div id="myDiv">Original text</div>

```js
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
const div = document.getElementById('myDiv');

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  div.innerText = 'New text!';
});
```
This script uses the `addEventListener` method to listen for a click event on the button element. When the button is clicked, the event listener function is called, which changes the text content of the div element using the `innerText` property.

You can test this script by creating an HTML file with the above code and opening it in a browser. Clicking the button should change the text of the div element.

Note: This script uses the `addEventListener` method to handle the DOM event, which is a widely supported and best practice approach. The `getElementById` method is used to select the elements, which is a common way to interact with the DOM.

### Gemini

**HTML:**

```html
<button id="change-text-button">Change Text</button>
<div id="text-to-change">This is the initial text.</div>
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById("change-text-button");
const textDiv = document.getElementById("text-to-change");

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  textDiv.textContent = "The text has been changed!";
});
```

**Explanation:**

1. **HTML:**
    * We define a button with the ID "change-text-button" to trigger the text change.
    * We also define a div element with the ID "text-to-change" that holds the initial text.
2. **JavaScript:**
    * We use `document.getElementById` to get references to both the button and the div element.
    * We use `button.addEventListener` to attach a click event listener to the button.
    * Inside the event listener function:
        * We access the div element's text content using `textDiv.textContent`.
        * We update the text content with the new message "The text has been changed!".

**Testing the Script:**

1. Save the HTML and JavaScript code together in a file (e.g., index.html).
2. Open the file in a web browser.
3. Click the button. The text in the div element should change to the new message.

**Additional Notes:**

* This script uses a separate JavaScript file for better organization. You can include the script in the HTML using a `<script>` tag.
* You can further customize the new text displayed based on your needs.

This example demonstrates how the tools suggest handling DOM events by using `addEventListener` for attaching event listeners and accessing DOM elements using `document.getElementById`.

# 3-array-manipulation

# 3. Array Manipulation

## Prompt

This code should filter an array of numbers, returning only those that are even. This simple task checks how the tools manage array operations and provide an example of use and its test.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```js

function getEvenNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
}

```
The `filter()` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array. The callback function should return `true` if the element should be included in the new array, and `false` otherwise. 

In this case, the callback function checks if the current number `num` is even by using the modulo operator `%`
. If the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is 0, then the number is even, and the callback function returns `true`.
Here's an example of how to use the `getEvenNumbers()` function:

```js

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = getEvenNumbers(numbers);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

```

To test this function, you can create a test suite using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. Here's an example using Jest:

```js

test('getEvenNumbers should return only even numbers', () => {
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  const evenNumbers = getEvenNumbers(numbers);
  expect(evenNumbers).toEqual([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]);
});

```

This test checks that the `getEvenNumbers()` function correctly filters an array of numbers and returns only the even numbers.


### GitHub Copilot

Based on your description, here's a simple JavaScript function that filters an array to return only even numbers, along with a basic unit test using Jest.

```js
// Function to filter even numbers
function filterEvenNumbers(numbers) {
    return numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
}

// Jest unit test
test('filterEvenNumbers function', () => {
    expect(filterEvenNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])).toEqual([2, 4]);
});
```

This function uses the `filter` method of the Array prototype, which iterates over each element in the array and includes it in the returned array if the provided callback function returns `true`. In this case, the callback checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). The unit test checks if the function correctly filters out odd numbers.

### Axet Gaia


```js
// Define an array of numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Use the filter method to create a new array with only the even numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

// Print the result
console.log(evenNumbers);
```

**Explanation**

- We start by defining an array of numbers using the `const` keyword.
- Then, we use the `filter` method on the array to create a new array that only contains the even numbers. The `filter` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element in the array. In this case, the callback function checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0.
- Finally, we print the result using `console.log`.

This solution follows best practices by using modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and the `filter` method, which provide a concise and readable way to solve the problem.

### ChatGpt 4

Here's a simple JavaScript function that filters an array of numbers and returns only the even numbers. This example will help you see how code completion tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer handle array operations.

**JavaScript Function to Filter Even Numbers**

```js
function filterEvenNumbers(numbers) {
    return numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
}

// Example usage
const arrayOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = filterEvenNumbers(arrayOfNumbers);
console.log(evenNumbers);  // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Explanation**

- **Function Definition**: `filterEvenNumbers` takes an array of numbers as input.
- **Filter Method**: It uses the `filter` method of the array, which iterates over each element in the array.
- **Callback Function**: The callback function for the `filter` method checks if a number is even (`number % 2 === 0`). If this condition is true, the number is included in the returned array.
- **Example Usage**: The function is demonstrated with an array of integers from 1 to 10.

**Testing the Function**

To test this function, you can run it in any JavaScript environment that supports ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later, such as modern web browsers or Node.js. Here's how you can quickly test it in a web browser:

1. **Open Your Browser**: Open your favorite browser that supports modern JavaScript features.
2. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on macOS) to open developer tools.
3. **Go to the Console Tab**: Click on the "Console" tab in the developer tools window.
4. **Paste and Run the Function**: Copy the `filterEvenNumbers` function code provided above and paste it into the console, then press Enter.
5. **View the Output**: After running the function, you should see `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` logged to the console.

This simple test will confirm that the function is correctly filtering the array to return only even numbers, demonstrating the function's ability to perform array operations effectively.

### Meta.ai

Here is a simple script that filters an array of numbers, returning only those that are even:

```js
// Function to filter even numbers
function filterEvenNumbers(arr) {
  return arr.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
}

// Example usage
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = filterEvenNumbers(numbers);

// Test
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

```
This script defines a function `filterEvenNumbers` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with only the even numbers. The `filter` method is used with a callback function that checks if a number is even by using the modulo operator `(num % 2 === 0)`.

The example usage shows how to call the function with an array of numbers, and the test logs the resulting array of even numbers to the console.

This code demonstrates how to perform array filtering, which is a common task in programming, and shows how the tools handle array operations.

### Gemini


**JavaScript:**

```javascript
function filterEvenNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`function filterEvenNumbers(numbers)`:** This defines a function named `filterEvenNumbers` that takes an array of numbers as input.
2. **`return numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);`:**
   * This line uses the built-in `filter` method on the `numbers` array.
   * The `filter` method takes a callback function as an argument.
   * The callback function receives each element (`number`) from the array.
   * The condition `number % 2 === 0` checks if the number is even using the modulo operator (`%`).
   * If the condition is true, the element is included in the filtered array. Otherwise, it's excluded.
   * Finally, the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the even numbers.

**Example of Use:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = filterEvenNumbers(numbers);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

**Test:**

```javascript
function testFilterEvenNumbers() {
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  const expectedEvenNumbers = [2, 4, 6];
  const actualEvenNumbers = filterEvenNumbers(numbers);

  // Test if the returned array is equal to the expected even numbers
  const testPassed = JSON.stringify(actualEvenNumbers) === JSON.stringify(expectedEvenNumbers);
  console.assert(testPassed, "filterEvenNumbers failed!");
}

testFilterEvenNumbers();
```

**Explanation of Test:**

1. **`testFilterEvenNumbers` function:** This function tests the `filterEvenNumbers` function.
2. It defines two variables:
   * `numbers`: An array containing a mix of even and odd numbers.
   * `expectedEvenNumbers`: The expected output – an array containing only the even numbers from `numbers`.
3. It calls `filterEvenNumbers` with the `numbers` array and stores the result in `actualEvenNumbers`.
4. It uses `JSON.stringify` to convert both arrays to JSON strings for comparison.
5. It uses `console.assert` to check if the stringified versions of `actualEvenNumbers` and `expectedEvenNumbers` are equal. If not, it logs an error message.

This example demonstrates how the tools manage array operations using the `filter` method and showcases a testing approach using `console.assert` for basic functionality verification.

# 4-promise-handling

# 4. Promise Handling

## Prompt

Write a function that returns a new Promise that resolves with a specific value after a delay. This will test the tools' ability to handle JavaScript Promises and asynchronous logic and provide an example of use and its test.

## Results

### Amazon Q

Here's a JavaScript function that returns a new Promise that resolves with a specific value after a delay:

```js

function delay(value, ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(value);
    }, ms);
  });
}


```

This `delay()` function takes two arguments:

`value` the value to be resolved by the Promise

`ms` the delay in milliseconds before the Promise is resolved

The function returns a new Promise that is created using the `new Promise()` constructor. The Promise's executor function uses `setTimeout()` to delay the resolution of the Promise by the specified number of milliseconds, and then calls the `resolve()` function with the provided `value`.

Here's an example of how to use the `delay()` function:

```js

delay('Hello, world!', 2000)
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result); // Output: "Hello, world!"
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });


```

In this example, the `delay()` function is called with the string `'Hello, world!'` and a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). The returned Promise is then handled using the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

To test this function, you can create a test suite using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. Here's an example using Jest:

```js

test('delay function should resolve with the correct value after the specified delay', async () => {
  const result = await delay('Test value', 1000);
  expect(result).toBe('Test value');
});


```

This test checks that the `delay()` function correctly resolves the Promise with the provided value after the specified delay.



### GitHub Copilot

Here is the JavaScript function that returns a new Promise that resolves with a specific value after a delay:

```js
function delayPromise(value, delay) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(value);
        }, delay);
    });
}
```

And here is a simple unit test for this function using Jest:

```js
test('delayPromise resolves with correct value after delay', () => {
    return delayPromise('test value', 1000).then(data => {
        expect(data).toBe('test value');
    });
});
```

This test will call the `delayPromise` function with a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and a value of 'test value'. After the delay, the Promise should resolve with the value 'test value', which is what the test checks for.

### Axet Gaia


```js
// Function that returns a Promise that resolves with a specific value after a delay
function delayedPromise(value, delay) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(value);
    }, delay);
  });
}

// Example usage of the delayedPromise function
delayedPromise("Hello, world!", 2000)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Output: Hello, world!
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });

// Test the delayedPromise function
async function testDelayedPromise() {
  try {
    const result = await delayedPromise("Test value", 1000);
    console.log(result); // Output: Test value
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

testDelayedPromise();
```

**Explanation**

- The `delayedPromise` function takes two parameters: `value` (the value to be resolved with) and `delay` (the delay in milliseconds).
- Inside the function, we create a new Promise using the `Promise` constructor. The promise will resolve with the specified `value` after the specified `delay`.
- We use `setTimeout` to delay the resolution of the promise.
- The example usage demonstrates how to use the `delayedPromise` function. It waits for 2 seconds and then logs the resolved value to the console.
- The test function `testDelayedPromise` demonstrates how to use the `delayedPromise` function with async/await syntax. It waits for 1 second and then logs the resolved value to the console.

This code follows best practices for JavaScript by using Promises for asynchronous operations, handling errors with `catch`, and using async/await for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.

### ChatGpt 4

Certainly! Below is an example of a JavaScript function that creates a new Promise which resolves with a specific value after a delay. This function is a great way to test how code completion tools handle JavaScript Promises and asynchronous programming.

**JavaScript Function Returning a Promise**

```js
function resolveAfterDelay(value, delay) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(value);
        }, delay);
    });
}

// Example usage
resolveAfterDelay('Hello, world!', 2000) // Resolves with 'Hello, world!' after 2 seconds
    .then(message => console.log(message));
```

**Explanation**

- **Function Definition**: `resolveAfterDelay` takes two parameters: `value`, the value to resolve the promise with, and `delay`, the time in milliseconds to wait before the promise is resolved.
- **Returning a Promise**: The function returns a new Promise. The executor function for the Promise calls `setTimeout` to resolve the promise after a specified delay.
- **Resolving the Promise**: Inside the `setTimeout`, the `resolve` function is called with the given `value`, which resolves the promise.
- **Example Usage**: In the example, the function is called with the string "Hello, world!" and a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). The `then` method is used to handle the resolved value and log it to the console.

**Testing the Function**

To test this function in a web browser or Node.js environment:

1. **Open Your Browser or Node.js**: For browser testing, open your favorite browser and access the developer tools console as previously described. For Node.js, ensure you have Node installed and use the terminal or an IDE.
2. **Run the Function**: Copy and paste the code into the console or your Node.js environment.
3. **Observe the Behavior**: After the specified delay, you should see the message "Hello, world!" printed to the console.

This test demonstrates the function’s ability to handle asynchronous tasks using Promises and `setTimeout`, which is a common pattern for dealing with operations that require a wait time, such as API calls, file operations, or simply delaying task execution in JavaScript.

### Meta.ai

Here is a simple function that returns a new Promise that resolves with a specific value after a delay:

```js
// Function to create a delayed promise
function delayPromise(value, delay) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(value);
    }, delay);
  });
}

// Example usage
const promise = delayPromise("Resolved!", 2000);

// Test
promise.then(value => console.log(value)); // Output: "Resolved!" (after 2 seconds)

```

This function, `delayPromise`, takes two arguments: `value` and `delay`. It returns a new Promise that resolves with the value after the specified delay (in milliseconds).

In the example usage, we create a promise that resolves with the string "Resolved!" after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). The test uses the then method to log the resolved value to the console.

This code demonstrates how to work with Promises and asynchronous logic, which is a fundamental aspect of JavaScript programming.

### Gemini


```javascript
function delayedResolve(value, delay) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(value), delay);
  });
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`function delayedResolve(value, delay)`:** This defines a function named `delayedResolve` that takes two arguments:
   * `value`: The value the promise will eventually resolve with.
   * `delay`: The delay in milliseconds before resolving the promise.
2. **`return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... })`:** This line returns a new Promise object. The provided callback function defines what happens when the promise resolves or rejects.
3. **`setTimeout(() => resolve(value), delay)`:** Inside the callback:
   * We use `setTimeout` to schedule the execution of a function after the specified delay.
   * The function passed to `setTimeout` calls the `resolve` function with the provided `value`.

**Example of Use:**

```javascript
const delayedPromise = delayedResolve("Hello!", 2000);

delayedPromise.then(value => console.log(value)); // Logs "Hello!" after 2 seconds
```

**Test:**

```javascript
function testDelayedResolve() {
  const testValue = "Test Value";
  const delay = 1000;

  return delayedResolve(testValue, delay)
    .then(value => {
      if (value === testValue) {
        console.log("Test passed!");
        return true; // Indicate successful test
      } else {
        console.error("Test failed! Unexpected value:", value);
        return false; // Indicate failed test
      }
    });
}

const testResult = testDelayedResolve();

// Optionally, use a testing framework to handle the test result
if (typeof testResult.then === "function") {
  testResult.then(passed => {
    console.assert(passed, "testDelayedResolve failed!");
  });
} else {
  console.assert(testResult, "testDelayedResolve failed!");
}
```

**Explanation of Test:**

1. **`testDelayedResolve` function:** This function tests the `delayedResolve` function.
2. It defines `testValue` and `delay` for the test.
3. It calls `delayedResolve` with these values and returns the promise.
4. It uses `.then` to handle the resolved value.
5. Inside the `.then` callback:
   * It checks if the resolved value (`value`) matches the `testValue`.
   * If it matches, it logs a success message and returns `true`.
   * Otherwise, it logs an error message and returns `false`.
6. The overall test result is stored in `testResult`.
7. We check if `testResult` is a promise (using `typeof testResult.then === "function"`) to handle different testing frameworks.
8. If it's a promise, we use `.then` to handle the final test outcome (`passed`).
9. We use `console.assert` to verify the test passed based on the returned value (`passed`).

This example demonstrates how the tools handle JavaScript Promises using the `Promise` constructor, `setTimeout` for delays, and asynchronous operations using `.then`. The test showcases a basic approach using `console.assert` and handling test results based on framework support.

# 5-express-server-setup

# 5. Express.js Server Setup

## Prompt

A simple Express server setup that can handle a basic GET request.

## Results

### Amazon Q

Certainly, here's a simple example of setting up an Express server that can handle a basic GET request: 

```js

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a GET route for the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});


```

In this example, we first import the `express` module and create an instance of the Express application using `express()`. We then define a port number (in this case, `3000`) that the server will listen on.

Next, we define a GET route for the root URL (`/`) using the `app.get()` method. This method takes two arguments: the route path and a callback function that handles the request and response objects.

In the callback function, we use the `res.send()` method to send the string `'Hello, World!'` as the response.

Finally, we start the server and have it listen on the specified port using the `app.listen()` method. This will log a message to the console indicating that the server is running.

To test this server, you can save the code in a file (e.g., `server.js`) and run it using Node.js:

```node
node server.js
```

Then, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed.
This is a basic example of setting up an Express server and handling a simple GET request. Express provides a lot of additional functionality and features for building more complex web applications, such as handling different HTTP methods, parsing request bodies, and serving static files. The resources provided earlier in the conversation cover more advanced topics related to Express.js and server-side JavaScript development.


### GitHub Copilot

It seems like you're looking to create a simple Express server that can handle a basic GET request. Here's a step-by-step plan and the corresponding code:

1. Import the express module.
2. Initialize an instance of express.
3. Define a route handler for the GET request to the root URL ("/").
4. Start the server on a specific port.

Here's the JavaScript code for the above steps:

```js
// Step 1: Import the express module
const express = require('express');

// Step 2: Initialize an instance of express
const app = express();

// Step 3: Define a route handler for the GET request to the root URL ("/")
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Step 4: Start the server on a specific port
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

You can run this server by saving the code in a file (for example, `server.js`), and then running `node server.js` in your terminal. You should see the message "Server running on http://localhost:3000" in your terminal, and if you navigate to that URL in your web browser, you should see the message "Hello World!".

### Axet Gaia


```js
// Import the required modules
const express = require('express');

// Create an instance of the Express server
const app = express();

// Define a route for the GET request
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server and listen on a specific port
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

**Explanation**

- First, we import the `express` module, which is a popular framework for building web applications in Node.js.
- Then, we create an instance of the Express server by calling `express()`.
- Next, we define a route for the GET request using the `app.get()` method. In this example, the route is `'/'`, which means it will handle requests to the root URL.
- Inside the route handler function, we use the `res.send()` method to send a response back to the client. In this case, we're sending the string `'Hello, World!'`.
- Finally, we start the server by calling `app.listen()` and specify the port number to listen on. In this example, the server will listen on port 3000.

This is a basic setup for an Express server that can handle a GET request. You can build upon this foundation to add more routes and functionality as needed. Remember to install the `express` module using npm before running this code.

### ChatGpt 4

Below is a simple example of setting up an Express.js server that can handle a basic GET request.

**Simple Express.js Server Setup**

First, ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Next, you'll need to set up a new Node.js project and install Express:

1. **Create a new directory** for your project and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-express-server
   cd my-express-server
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install Express**:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

Now, create a file named `server.js` and add the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

**Explanation**

- **Require Express**: The `express` module is required at the beginning of the file.
- **Create an Express Application**: `app` is created by calling `express()`.
- **Define a Route Handler**: `app.get('/')` defines a route handler for GET requests to the root URL (`/`). It sends back a response with the text "Hello, Express!".
- **Start the Server**: `app.listen(PORT, callback)` starts the server on the specified `PORT`. The callback function confirms that the server is running.

**Testing the Server**

To test the server, follow these steps:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open a web browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see "Hello, Express!" displayed on the page.

3. **Alternatively, use a tool like Postman or cURL** to send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000`. For cURL, you can use the command:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```

This setup provides a straightforward example of how an Express server handles GET requests, and it should work smoothly with most code completion tools, providing suggestions for common Express server configurations and API setups.

### Meta.ai

Here is a simple Express server setup that can handle a basic GET request:

```js
// Import the Express module
const express = require('express');

// Create a new Express app
const app = express();

// Define a route for the GET request
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
});

```

This code:

- Imports the Express module
- Creates a new Express app
- Defines a route for the GET request at the root URL ("/")
- Returns "Hello, World!" as the response
- Starts the server on port 3000
  
You can test this server by running the code and visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

This is a very basic example, but it demonstrates the basic setup and routing functionality of an Express server.


### Gemini


```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

// Define the port number (default to 3000)
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Route handler for the root path (/) with a GET request
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from the simple Express server!');
});

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`const express = require('express');`:** This line imports the Express framework.
2. **`const app = express();`:** This creates an instance of the Express application.
3. **`const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;`:** This defines the port number on which the server will listen. It checks for an environment variable `PORT` first, otherwise defaults to 3000.
4. **`app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... })`:** This defines a route handler for the root path (`/`). 
    * The first argument (`req`) represents the incoming request object.
    * The second argument (`res`) represents the outgoing response object we can use to send data back to the client.
    * Inside the callback function, we use `res.send` to send a simple text response "Hello from the simple Express server!".
5. **`app.listen(port, () => { ... })`:** This starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port.
    * The callback function logs a message indicating the server is listening.

**Running the Server:**

1. Save the code in a file (e.g., server.js).
2. Open a terminal in the directory where you saved the file.
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install express`
4. Run the server: `node server.js`

**Testing the Server:**

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:${port}` (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
2. You should see the message "Hello from the simple Express server!" displayed in the browser.

This is a basic example. You can extend this further to handle more complex routes, request parameters, response formats, and middleware for additional functionalities.

     const port = 3000;

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, World!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
     });
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Like Amazon Q, it offers a clear step-by-step setup for an Express server. The explanation is direct and the code follows best practices.
   - **Cons**: Similar to Amazon Q, it lacks depth in terms of handling more complex scenarios or additional routes.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```js
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = 3000;

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello World!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
     });
     ```

     ```js
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const PORT = 3000;

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
         res.send('Hello, Express!');
     });

     app.listen(PORT, () => {
         console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
     });
     ```

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, World!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
     });
     ```

### Gemini
   - **Pros**: Includes a useful addition by incorporating the `process.env.PORT` for the port setting, which is a best practice for deployment scenarios where the port might be assigned by the environment.
   - **Cons**: The explanation and code are very similar to the other examples, but the use of environment variables is a plus.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello from the simple Express server!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
     });
     ```

## Conclusion

**Best Code**: **ChatGPT 4** and **Gemini** stand out, with ChatGPT 4 providing a complete guide that is very helpful for newcomers, and Gemini introducing an aspect of real-world applicability by using `process.env.PORT`.

**Worst Code**: It’s hard to designate a "worst" since all submissions correctly fulfill the basic requirement. However, **Meta.ai** and **Axet Gaia** offer the least in terms of additional insights or learning enhancements compared to others.

  console.log(boxen(content, { title, borderColor: color }));
}

class ChatModelStartHandler {

  }
}


```

The key differences between the Python and JavaScript versions are:

The `boxen` function is imported from the `boxen` package in JavaScript, whereas it's a part of the `pyboxen` module in Python.

The `boxenPrint` function takes the `borderColor` option instead of the `color` option in Python.

The `onChatModelStart` method is used instead of the `on_chat_model_start` method in Python.

The `forEach` method is used to iterate over the `messages` array in JavaScript, whereas a `for` loop is used in Python.

The `switch` statement is used to handle the different message types in JavaScript, instead of the `if-elif` statements in Python.

Please note that this is a direct translation of the Python code to JavaScript, and you may need to adjust it further to fit your specific use case.


### GitHub Copilot

Here's the JavaScript equivalent of your Python code. Note that JavaScript doesn't have a direct equivalent to Python's `boxen` library. For simplicity, I've replaced `boxen_print` with a simple `console.log` statement. If you want a similar boxen effect, you might need to use or create a custom JavaScript library.

```js
class ChatModelStartHandler {
    onChatModelStart(serialized, messages, kwargs) {
        console.log("\n\n\n\n========= Sending Messages =========\n\n");
        for (let message of messages[0]) {
            this.printMessage(message);
        }
    }

    printMessage(message) {
        let content = message.content;
        let title = message.type;
        let color = null;

        switch (message.type) {
            case "system":
                color = "yellow";
                break;
            case "human":
                color = "green";
                break;
            case "ai":
                if (message.additional_kwargs && message.additional_kwargs.function_call) {
                    let call = message.additional_kwargs.function_call;
                    content = `Running tool ${call.name} with args ${call.arguments}`;
                    color = "cyan";
                } else {
                    color = "blue";
                }
                break;
            case "function":
                color = "purple";
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }

        this.boxenPrint(content, title, color);
    }

    boxenPrint(content, title, color) {
        console.log(`${title}: ${content} (${color})`);
    }
}
```

This JavaScript code creates a class `ChatModelStartHandler` with methods `onChatModelStart` and `printMessage` similar to the Python code. The `printMessage` method uses a switch statement to handle different message types, and calls `boxenPrint` to print the message. The `boxenPrint` method simply logs the content, title, and color to the console.

### Axet Gaia

```js
function boxenPrint(content, title, color) {
  console.log(boxen(content, { title: title, borderColor: color }));
}

class ChatModelStartHandler {
  on_chat_model_start(serialized, messages, ...kwargs) {
    console.log("\n\n\n\n========= Sending Messages =========\n\n");
    for (let message of messages[0]) {
      this.printMessage(message);
    }
  }

  printMessage(message) {
    if (message.type === "system") {
      boxenPrint(message.content, { title: message.type, borderColor: "yellow" });
    } else if (message.type === "human") {
      boxenPrint(message.content, { title: message.type, borderColor: "green" });
    } else if (message.type === "ai" && "function_call" in message.additional_kwargs) {
      const call = message.additional_kwargs["function_call"];
      boxenPrint(
        `Running tool ${call['name']} with args ${call['arguments']}`,
        { title: message.type, borderColor: "cyan" }
      );
    } else if (message.type === "ai") {
      boxenPrint(message.content, { title: message.type, borderColor: "blue" });
    } else if (message.type === "function") {
      boxenPrint(message.content, { title: message.type, borderColor: "purple" });
    } else {
      boxenPrint(message.content, { title: message.type });
    }
  }
}
```

In this solution, I've created a `boxenPrint` function that wraps the `boxen` function from the `pyboxen` library. This function takes the `content`, `title`, and `color` parameters and logs the boxed content to the console.

Then, I've implemented the `ChatModelStartHandler` class with the `on_chat_model_start` and `printMessage` methods. The `on_chat_model_start` method logs a header message to the console and iterates over the `messages` array, calling the `printMessage` method for each message.

The `printMessage` method checks the `type` property of each message and calls the `boxenPrint` function with the appropriate parameters based on the message type.

Note: This solution assumes that the `boxen` function is already imported and available in the JavaScript environment.

### ChatGpt 4

To convert the given Python code to JavaScript, we'll first need to address the differences in class definitions, method syntax, and the way Python and JavaScript handle libraries and printing. Since JavaScript doesn't have a direct equivalent to the `boxen` library used in Python, we'll need to emulate or simplify that functionality. For demonstration, we'll create a simple function to replace `boxen_print` and use `console.log` for displaying messages.

Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:

```js
class ChatModelStartHandler {
    constructor() {
        this.boxenPrint = (content, title, color) => {
            // Emulating boxen's behavior with console.log for simplicity
            console.log(`[${title}] (${color}): ${content}`);
        };
    }

    onChatModelStart(serialized, messages, kwargs) {
        console.log("\n\n\n\n========= Sending Messages =========\n\n");
        messages[0].forEach(message => {
            this.printMessage(message);
        });
    }

    printMessage(message) {
        if (message.type === "system") {
            this.boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "yellow");
        } else if (message.type === "human") {
            this.boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "green");
        } else if (message.type === "ai" && "function_call" in message.additionalKwargs) {
            const call = message.additionalKwargs.function_call;
            this.boxenPrint(
                `Running tool ${call.name} with args ${JSON.stringify(call.arguments)}`,
                message.type,
                "cyan"
            );
        } else if (message.type === "ai") {
            this.boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "blue");
        } else if (message.type === "function") {
            this.boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "purple");
        } else {
            this.boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "default");
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
const handler = new ChatModelStartHandler();
handler.onChatModelStart(null, [[
    {type: "system", content: "System message"},
    {type: "human", content: "Human message"},
    {type: "ai", content: "AI message"},
    {type: "function", content: "Function message"},
    {type: "ai", additionalKwargs: {function_call: {name: "fetchData", arguments: {url: "http://example.com"}}}, content: "AI function call message"}
]], {});
```

**Key Changes:**

1. **Boxen Replacement**: In the absence of a direct equivalent for `boxen`, I've used `console.log` to format the output similarly, using square brackets and colors as part of the text. Real color output in the console would require additional libraries like `chalk` or similar in a Node.js environment.
2. **Method Syntax**: Switched to JavaScript method syntax within the `class`.
3. **Iteration Over Arrays**: Replaced Python's `for` loop with JavaScript's `Array.prototype.forEach` for iterating over messages.
4. **Object Property Access**: Changed the way additional arguments are accessed to fit JavaScript's object property access patterns.

This code should work in a Node.js environment or in modern browsers if adapted for client-side use. Remember, JavaScript executed in browsers does not have access to Node.js libraries like `chalk` unless bundled with tools like Webpack and used with a compatible library for the browser.

### Meta.ai

```js
function boxenPrint(content, title, color) {
  console.log(boxen(content, { title, color }));
}

class ChatModelStartHandler {
  onChatModelStart(serialized, messages, kwargs) {
    console.log("\n\n\n\n========= Sending Messages =========\n\n");
    for (const message of messages[0]) {
      this.printMessage(message);
    }
  }

  printMessage(message) {
    switch (message.type) {
      case "system":
        boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "yellow");
        break;
      case "human":
        boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "green");
        break;
      case "ai":
        if (message.additional_kwargs && "function_call" in message.additional_kwargs) {
          const call = message.additional_kwargs.function_call;
          boxenPrint(`Running tool ${call.name} with args ${call.arguments}`, message.type, "cyan");
        } else {
          boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "blue");
        }
        break;
      case "function":
        boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, "purple");
        break;
      default:
        boxenPrint(message.content, message.type);
    }
  }
}

```

Note that in JavaScript, we don't have the equivalent of Python's `**kwargs` syntax, so I've replaced it with an object `kwargs` that is not used in this code snippet. Also, the `boxen` function is not implemented in JavaScript, so you'll need to find a library or implement it yourself.

This code uses the console.log function to print the messages, and the `boxenPrint` function to format the messages with colors. The `switch` statement is used to determine the color based on the message type, similar to the Python code.

### Gemini


**1. `boxen_print` function:**

- This function likely uses a library named `pyboxen` (not included here) to format and print the provided content within a visually appealing box.
- It takes three arguments:
    - `content`: The text to be displayed inside the box.
    - `title`: The title displayed above the content.
    - `color`: The color of the box (likely uses color names supported by `pyboxen`).

**2. `ChatModelStartHandler` class:**

- This class seems to be responsible for handling the start of a chat model session.
- It has a method named `on_chat_model_start` that takes several arguments:
    - `serialized`: Probably a serialized representation of the chat session data.
    - `messages`: A list of messages received during the chat.
    - `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments.
- Inside `on_chat_model_start`:
    - It prints a separator line.
    - Loops through each message in the `messages` list and calls the `print_message` method for each message.

**3. `print_message` function:**

- This function handles printing individual messages based on their type.
- It takes a single argument: `message` which is an object representing the chat message.
    - The message object likely has properties like:
        - `type`: The type of message (e.g., "system", "human", "ai").
        - `content`: The actual content of the message.
        - `additional_kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments specific to the message type.
- Based on the message type, `print_message` uses `boxen_print` with different colors to format and print the message content and title.

**Overall:**

This code snippet seems to be part of a larger system for processing and displaying chat messages. It utilizes different colors to visually differentiate between different message types (system, human, AI, etc.) for better readability.

**Note:** Without the `pyboxen` library, the code won't be able to actually render the box formatting.



## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Provides a straightforward and clear translation of the Python code into JavaScript, effectively using the `boxen` library to match the Python `pyboxen` module functionality. The method names and structure closely mirror the original Python class.
   - **Cons**: None significant; the translation is robust and adheres closely to the provided Python functionality.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```js
     const boxen = require('boxen');

     function boxenPrint(content, title, color) {
       console.log(boxen(content, { title, borderColor: color }));
     }

     class ChatModelStartHandler {
       onChatModelStart(serialized, messages, ...kwargs) {
         console.log('\n\n\n\n========= Sending Messages =========\n\n');
         messages[0].forEach(message => this.printMessage(message));
       }

       printMessage(message) {
         switch (message.type) {
           case 'system':
             boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, 'yellow');
             break;
           case 'human':
             boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, 'green');
             break;
           case 'ai':
             if ('function_call' in message.additional_kwargs) {
               const { name, arguments: args } = message.additional_kwargs.function_call;
               boxenPrint(`Running tool ${name} with args ${args}`, message.type, 'cyan');
             } else {
               boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, 'blue');
             }
             break;
           case 'function':
             boxenPrint(message.content, message.type, 'purple');
             break;
           default:
             boxenPrint(message.content, message.type);
             break;
         }
       }
     }
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: The solution attempts to simplify the function calls and method implementations by using more generic JavaScript functionalities like `console.log` to simulate the `boxen` output.
   - **Cons**: Does not utilize the `boxen` library for output, which reduces fidelity to the original Python's `boxen` visual output.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```js
     class ChatModelStartHandler {
         onChatModelStart(serialized, messages, kwargs) {
             console.log("\n\n\n\n========= Sending Messages =========\n\n");
             for (let message of messages[0]) {
                 this.printMessage(message);
             }
         }

         printMessage(message) {
             let content = message.content;
             let title = message.type;
             let color = null;

             switch (message.type) {

                         let call = message.additional_kwargs.function_call;
                         content = `Running tool ${call.name} with args ${call.arguments}`;
                         color = "cyan";
                     } else {

# 7-array-reduce

# 7. Array reduce

## Prompt

I have this array. I need to create a report of the total items sold and the total price avoiding products repetitions. 


```js
const lineItems = [
  { description: 'Eggs (Dozen)', quantity: 1, price: 3, total: 3 },
  { description: 'Cheese', quantity: 0.5, price: 5, total: 2.5 },
  { description: 'Butter', quantity: 2, price: 6, total: 12 },
  { description: 'Eggs (Dozen)', quantity: 4, price: 3, total: 12 },
];
```

## Results

### Amazon Q


Okay, let's tackle this step-by-step:

- We need to create an object that will store the total quantity and total price for each unique product. This will allow us to avoid repetitions.

- We'll iterate through the `lineItems` array and update the totals in the object as we go.

- Finally, we'll log out the report with the total items sold and total price for each unique product.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```js
const report = {};

for (const item of lineItems) {
  const { description, quantity, price, total } = item;
  report[description].totalQuantity += quantity;
  report[description].totalPrice += total;
}

console.log('Product Report:');
for (const [product, stats] of Object.entries(report)) {
}

```

The key steps are:

1. Initialize an empty `report` object to store the totals.

2. Iterate through the `lineItems` array.

3. For each item, check if the `description` is already a key in the `report` object. If not, initialize it with `totalQuantity` and `totalPrice` properties.

4. Update the `totalQuantity` and `totalPrice` for the current `description`.

5. After the loop, iterate through the `report` object and log out the product details.

This will give you the following output:


```bash
Product Report:
Eggs (Dozen) - Total Quantity: 5, Total Price: $15.00
Cheese - Total Quantity: 0.5, Total Price: $2.50
Butter - Total Quantity: 2, Total Price: $12.00

```

The key benefit of this approach is that it avoids repetitions and calculates the totals for each unique product in the 
lineItems `array`.


### GitHub Copilot

To create a report of the total items sold and the total price avoiding product repetitions, you can use JavaScript's `reduce` function. This function can be used to transform an array into a single value. In this case, we'll transform the `lineItems` array into an object where each key is a product description and each value is an object containing the total quantity and total price for that product.

Here's the JavaScript code to do this:

```js
const report = lineItems.reduce((acc, item) => {
  if (!acc[item.description]) {
    acc[item.description] = { totalQuantity: 0, totalPrice: 0 };
  }
  acc[item.description].totalQuantity += item.quantity;
  acc[item.description].totalPrice += item.total;
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(report);
```

This code will output an object like this:

```js
{
  'Eggs (Dozen)': { totalQuantity: 5, totalPrice: 15 },
  'Cheese': { totalQuantity: 0.5, totalPrice: 2.5 },
  'Butter': { totalQuantity: 2, totalPrice: 12 }
}
```

This object tells you the total quantity and total price for each product, without repeating products.

### Axet Gaia

Sure! Here's the JavaScript code that solves the problem while following best practices:

```js
const lineItems = [
  { description: 'Eggs (Dozen)', quantity: 1, price: 3, total: 3 },
  { description: 'Cheese', quantity: 0.5, price: 5, total: 2.5 },
  { description: 'Butter', quantity: 2, price: 6, total: 12 },
  { description: 'Eggs (Dozen)', quantity: 4, price: 3, total: 12 },
];

// Create an object to store the aggregated data
const report = {};

// Iterate over each line item
lineItems.forEach((item) => {
  // Check if the description already exists in the report object
  if (report[item.description]) {
    // If it exists, update the total quantity and price
    report[item.description].quantity += item.quantity;
    report[item.description].price += item.price;
  } else {
    // If it doesn't exist, add a new entry to the report object
    report[item.description] = {
      quantity: item.quantity,
      price: item.price,
    };
  }
});

// Print the report
console.log(report);
```

In this solution, we use an object called `report` to store the aggregated data. We iterate over each line item using the `forEach` method and check if the description already exists in the `report` object. If it does, we update the total quantity and price. If it doesn't, we add a new entry to the `report` object. Finally, we print the `report` object to see the result.

This solution avoids product repetitions by aggregating the quantity and price for items with the same description.

### ChatGpt 4

To generate a report of the total items sold and the total price for each product, while avoiding repetition of products in your list, you'll need to aggregate the data based on the product description. This involves summing the quantities and total prices for items with the same description.

Here's how you can do it in JavaScript:

**JavaScript Code to Aggregate Data**

```js
const lineItems = [
  { description: 'Eggs (Dozen)', quantity: 1, price: 3, total: 3 },
  { description: 'Cheese', quantity: 0.5, price: 5, total: 2.5 },
  { description: 'Butter', quantity: 2, price: 6, total: 12 },
  { description: 'Eggs (Dozen)', quantity: 4, price: 3, total: 12 },
];

function generateReport(items) {
  const report = items.reduce((acc, item) => {
    // Check if the item description already exists in the accumulator
    if (acc[item.description]) {
      // Update the existing entry
      acc[item.description].quantity += item.quantity;
      acc[item.description].total += item.total;
    } else {
      // Create a new entry
      acc[item.description] = {
        description: item.description,
        quantity: item.quantity,
        total: item.total,
        price: item.price
      };
    }
    return acc;
  }, {});

  return Object.values(report); // Convert the accumulated object back to an array
}

// Call the function and log the results
const reportItems = generateReport(lineItems);
console.log(reportItems);
```

**Explanation**

1. **Data Structure Initialization**: We start by defining an array of `lineItems`, where each item is an object that includes the product's description, quantity, price, and the total price for that line item.

2. **Aggregation Logic**:
   - We use the `reduce` function to aggregate line item data into an object where each key is a unique product description.
   - If a product description already exists in the accumulator object, we add the current line item's quantity and total to the existing entry.
   - If a product description does not exist, we add a new key to the object with the initial quantity and total values.

3. **Result Formatting**:
   - After reducing all items, we convert the results stored in the object back into an array using `Object.values()`. This makes it easier to handle and display the results.
   - Each item in the resulting array shows the total quantity and total price for each product, without any repetition.

The resulting output of the script will be an array of objects, where each object contains the total quantities and prices summed up for products with the same description. This approach ensures that each product is listed only once with the correct totals, making it ideal for generating reports or summaries of sales data.

### Meta.ai

You can use a JavaScript object to keep track of the unique products and their total quantity and price. Here's an example:

```js
const report = {};

lineItems.forEach((item) => {
  if (!report[item.description]) {
    report[item.description] = { quantity: 0, price: 0 };
  }
  report[item.description].quantity += item.quantity;
  report[item.description].price += item.total;
});

console.log(report);

```

This will output:
```json
{
  "Eggs (Dozen)": { quantity: 5, price: 15 },
  "Cheese": { quantity: 0.5, price: 2.5 },
  "Butter": { quantity: 2, price: 12 }
}
```

Then, you can calculate the total items sold and total price:

```js
const totalItemsSold = Object.values(report).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.quantity, 0);
const totalPrice = Object.values(report).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.price, 0);

console.log(`Total items sold: ${totalItemsSold}`);
console.log(`Total price: ${totalPrice}`);

```
```
This will output:
Total items sold: 7.5
Total price: 29.5
```

Note that this assumes that the description property is the unique identifier for each product. If that's not the case, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

### Gemini


```javascript
function generateSalesReport(lineItems) {
  // Use a Map to store product information (quantity and total price)
  const productReport = new Map();
  for (const item of lineItems) {
    const { description, quantity, price, total } = item;
    
    // Check if the product already exists in the Map
    if (productReport.has(description)) {
      // If it does, update the existing quantities and total price
      const existingProduct = productReport.get(description);
      existingProduct.quantity += quantity;
      existingProduct.total += total;
    } else {
      // If it doesn't, add a new entry for the product
      productReport.set(description, { quantity, total });
    }
  }

  // Generate the report header
  console.log("Sales Report:");

  // Loop through the Map entries and print product details
  for (const [product, info] of productReport.entries()) {
    console.log(`- ${product}: ${info.quantity} units, Total: $${info.total.toFixed(2)}`);
  }

  // Calculate and print the overall total items sold and total price
  const totalQuantity = [...productReport.values()].reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur.quantity, 0);
  const totalPrice = [...productReport.values()].reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur.total, 0);
  console.log(`\nTotal Items Sold: ${totalQuantity} units`);
  console.log(`Total Price: $${totalPrice.toFixed(2)}`);
}

generateSalesReport(lineItems);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`generateSalesReport(lineItems)` function:** This function takes the `lineItems` array as input.
2. **`const productReport = new Map();`:** We create a Map object named `productReport` to store information about each product (description, quantity, and total price).
3. **`for (const item of lineItems) { ... }`:** This loop iterates through each item in the `lineItems` array.
4. **`const { description, quantity, price, total } = item;`:** We destructure the item object to access its properties for readability.
5. **`if (productReport.has(description)) { ... } else { ... }`:** This conditional block checks if the product (identified by its description) already exists in the `productReport` Map.
   - If it exists (`has(description)` returns true), we update the existing entry by adding the current item's quantity and total price to the corresponding values in the Map.
   - If it doesn't exist (`has(description)` returns false), we create a new entry in the Map for the product with its quantity and total price from the current item.
6. **`console.log("Sales Report:");`:** We print the report header.
7. **`for (const [product, info] of productReport.entries()) { ... }`:** This loop iterates through each key-value pair in the `productReport` Map.
   - `product` represents the product description (key).
   - `info` is an object containing the quantity and total price for that product (value).
   - Inside the loop, we print each product's details with quantity and total price formatted to two decimal places using `toFixed(2)`.
8. **`const totalQuantity = ...;`:** We calculate the total quantity of items sold by summing up the quantities of all products in the Map using `reduce`.
9. **`const totalPrice = ...;`:** We calculate the total price by summing up the total prices of all products in the Map using `reduce`.
10. **`console.log(...);`:** Finally, we print the overall total items sold and total price with proper formatting.
11. **`generateSalesReport(lineItems);`:** We call the `generateSalesReport` function with the `lineItems` array to execute the report generation.

This approach uses a Map to efficiently store and update product information, avoiding repetitions. It then iterates through the Map to generate the desired sales report format.

## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Demonstrates an attempt to aggregate data into a simple object, making logical use of JavaScript's object properties for direct access and update.
   - **Cons**: The implementation is flawed due to missing initialization for properties in the report object, leading to runtime errors when attempting to increment undefined properties.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     const report = {};
     for (const item of lineItems) {
       const { description, quantity, total } = item;
       if (!report[description]) {
         report[description] = { totalQuantity: 0, totalPrice: 0 };
       }
       report[description].totalQuantity += quantity;
       report[description].totalPrice += total;
     }
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Correctly uses JavaScript's `reduce` function to build an aggregated report, ensuring that each product is accounted for without duplication.
   - **Cons**: Minimal explanatory commentary, which might be needed for less experienced developers.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     const report = lineItems.reduce((acc, item) => {
       if (!acc[item.description]) {
         acc[item.description] = { totalQuantity: 0, totalPrice: 0 };
       }
       acc[item.description].totalQuantity += item.quantity;
       acc[item.description].totalPrice += item.total;
       return acc;
     }, {});
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Employs a straightforward approach using a `forEach` loop, which is more readable for some developers.
   - **Cons**: Mismanages the data by incorrectly summing up the unit price rather than the total price, which can lead to inaccurate financial reports.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     const report = {};
     lineItems.forEach((item) => {
       if (report[item.description]) {
         report[item.description].quantity += item.quantity;
         report[item.description].price += item.price; // Error in handling the price should focus on `total`, not `price`
       } else {
         report[item.description] = {
           quantity: item.quantity,
           price: item.total, // Incorrect initialization, should focus on total price
         };
       }
     });
     ```

### ChatGPT 4
   - **Pros**: Provides a comprehensive solution by encapsulating the logic in a function, enhancing reusability and clarity; includes clear instructions for usage.

     ```javascript
     function generateReport(items) {
       return items.reduce((acc, item) => {
         if (!acc[item.description]) {
           acc[item.description] = { quantity: item.quantity, total: item.total };
         } else {
           acc[item.description].quantity += item.quantity;
           acc[item.description].total += item.total;
         }
         return acc;
       }, {});
     }
     const reportItems = generateReport(lineItems);
     console.log(reportItems);
     ```

### Meta.ai
   - **Pros**: Implements a simple iterative approach using `forEach`, correctly updating and initializing entries as needed.
   - **Cons**: Similar to other solutions, lacks detailed commentary which could aid in understanding the implementation.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     const report = {};
     lineItems.forEach((item) => {
       if (!report[item.description]) {
         report[item.description] = { quantity: 0, price: 0 };
       }
       report[item.description].quantity += item.quantity;
       report[item.description].price += item.total;
     });
     ```

### Gemini
   - **Pros**: Utilizes a `Map` to store product data, which is a robust way to handle key-value pairs in JavaScript. This approach ensures that all operations on the product data are clear and properly isolated.
   - **Cons**: More complex than necessary for straightforward tasks but provides excellent structure for scalability and readability.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     function generateSalesReport(lineItems) {
       const productReport = new Map();
       lineItems.forEach(item => {
         const { description, quantity, total } = item;
         if (!productReport.has(description)) {
           productReport.set(description, { quantity, total });
         } else {
           const product = productReport.get(description);
           product.quantity += quantity;
           product.total += total;
         }
       });
       return Array.from(productReport, ([description, data]) => ({ description, ...data }));
     }
     ```

## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **GitHub Copilot** provides the most robust solution using `reduce` effectively to aggregate the data into a single object with correct initializations and updates. It's concise, correct, and uses best practices.

**Worst Implementation**: **Axet Gaia**'s implementation, while attempting to solve the problem, incorrectly handles price calculations which could lead to significant errors in applications where financial accuracy is critical. 

**Note on Gemini**: The use of a `Map` object by Gemini offers a unique approach that provides excellent data integrity and readability, making it a strong contender for the best code practice in scenarios requiring detailed record management and future scalability.

In this code, we use the Flask framework to create a REST API with CRUD operations for managing books. The `/books` route is used to get all books and add a new book. The `/books/<int:book_id>` route is used to get a specific book, update an existing book, and delete a book. The books are stored in a list, and the data is sent and received in JSON format.

To run this code, you need to have Flask installed. You can install it using `pip install flask`. Then, you can run the code using `python filename.py`, where `filename.py` is the name of the Python file containing the code.

**How to Use This API**

1. **Create a Book**: Send a `POST` request to `/books` with JSON body containing `title`, `author`, and `publication_year`.
2. **Read All Books**: Send a `GET` request to `/books`.
3. **Read One Book**: Send a `GET` request to `/books/{book_id}` where `book_id` is the ID of the book you want to fetch.
4. **Update a Book**: Send a `PUT` request to `/books/{book_id}` with a JSON body containing updated `title`, `author`, and `publication_year`.
5. **Delete a Book**: Send a `DELETE` request to `/books/{book_id}`.

This code provides a fully functional REST API for a simple book management system. You can further enhance it by adding more features such as sorting, filtering, or user authentication based on your requirements.

### Meta.ai

Here is a simple implementation of a REST API using Flask for managing books:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# In-memory storage for books (replace with a database in a real application)
books = [
    {"id": 1, "title": "Book 1", "author": "Author 1", "year": 2020},
    {"id": 2, "title": "Book 2", "author": "Author 2", "year": 2021},
    {"id": 3, "title": "Book 3", "author": "Author 3", "year": 2022},
]

# GET all books
@app.route("/api/books", methods=["GET"])
def get_all_books():
    return jsonify(books)

# GET a book by ID
@app.route("/api/books/<int:book_id>", methods=["GET"])
def get_book(book_id):
    book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)
    if book is None:
        return jsonify({"error": "Book not found"}), 404
    return jsonify(book)

# POST a new book
@app.route("/api/books", methods=["POST"])
def create_book():
    new_book = {
        "id": len(books) + 1,
        "title": request.json["title"],
        "author": request.json["author"],
        "year": request.json["year"],
    }
    books.append(new_book)
    return jsonify(new_book), 201

# PUT (update) a book
@app.route("/api/books/<int:book_id>", methods=["PUT"])
def update_book(book_id):
    book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)
    if book is None:
        return jsonify({"error": "Book not found"}), 404
    book["title"] = request.json.get("title", book["title"])
    book["author"] = request.json.get("author", book["author"])
    book["year"] = request.json.get("year", book["year"])
    return jsonify(book)

# DELETE a book
@app.route("/api/books/<int:book_id>", methods=["DELETE"])
def delete_book(book_id):
    book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)
    if book is None:
        return jsonify({"error": "Book not found"}), 404
    books.remove(book)
    return jsonify({"message": "Book deleted"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This API has the following endpoints:

- `GET` `/api/books`: Returns a list of all books.
- `GET` `/api/books/<book_id>`: Returns a book by its ID.
- `POST` `/api/books`: Creates a new book.
- `PUT` `/api/books/<book_id>`: Updates a book by its ID.
- `DELETE` `/api/books/<book_id>`: Deletes a book by its ID.
- 
You can run the API by saving this code to a file (e.g., (`link unavailable`)) and running it with Python:
```bash
$ python (link unavailable)
```
Then, you can use a tool like curl or a REST client to interact with the API:
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:5000/api/books
```
This is a very basic implementation and you should consider using a database instead of an in-memory list for storing books. Also, error handling and input validation are minimal, so you should improve those aspects in a real application.

### Gemini


```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# In-memory storage (replace with a database for persistence)
books = []
next_id = 1


def generate_id():
    global next_id
    next_id += 1
    return next_id


def find_book(book_id):
    for book in books:
        if book['id'] == book_id:
            return book
    return None


# Create a book (POST)
@app.route('/books', methods=['POST'])
def create_book():
    data = request.get_json()
    if not data or not data.get('title') or not data.get('author') or not data.get('publication_year'):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required fields'}), 400

    new_book = {
        'id': generate_id(),
        'title': data['title'],
        'author': data['author'],
        'publication_year': data['publication_year'],
    }
    books.append(new_book)
    return jsonify(new_book), 201  # Created


# Read all books (GET)
@app.route('/books', methods=['GET'])
def get_all_books():
    return jsonify(books)


# Read a book by ID (GET)
@app.route('/books/<int:book_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_book(book_id):
    book = find_book(book_id)
    if not book:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Book not found'}), 404  # Not Found
    return jsonify(book)


# Update a book by ID (PUT)
@app.route('/books/<int:book_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_book(book_id):
    data = request.get_json()
    if not data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing data'}), 400

    book = find_book(book_id)
    if not book:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Book not found'}), 404

    # Update book fields with provided data (or keep existing values)
    book['title'] = data.get('title', book['title'])
    book['author'] = data.get('author', book['author'])
    book['publication_year'] = data.get('publication_year', book['publication_year'])

    return jsonify(book)


# Delete a book by ID (DELETE)
@app.route('/books/<int:book_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_book(book_id):
    book = find_book(book_id)
    if not book:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Book not found'}), 404

    books.remove(book)
    return jsonify({'message': 'Book deleted successfully'})


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation of the Completed Code:**

1. **CRUD Operations:**
   - **Create (POST) and Update (PUT):** These functionalities are already implemented as described previously.
   - **Read All (GET):** Retrieves and returns a JSON list of all books in the `books` list.
   - **Read by ID (GET):** Finds a book by its ID and returns the book object if found, otherwise a 404 Not Found error.
   - **Delete by ID (DELETE):** Finds a book by its ID, removes it from the `books` list, and returns a success message.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Each route checks for potential errors like missing data or non-existent books. It returns appropriate error messages with corresponding HTTP status codes for better client handling.

3. **In-memory Storage (Note):**
   - This example uses an in-memory list for simplicity. In a real application, you would replace it with a database (e.g., SQLAlchemy) for persistent storage and proper data management.

4. **Running the API:**
   - Save the code as a Python file (e.g., book_api.py).
   - Run the script: `python book_api.py`.
   - With the API running (debug mode enabled), you can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

This is a basic but functional REST API demonstrating CRUD operations for managing books. Remember to handle authentication and authorization for real-world deployments.

## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Provides a complete Flask app with CRUD operations, effectively handling different HTTP methods and responding appropriately.
   - **Cons**: Uses a simple in-memory list for storage which isn't practical for production but suffices for demonstration.
   - **Code Example**: Offers a clear structure, initializing, updating, and deleting entries correctly.
     ```python
     # Amazon's approach is straightforward and correctly implements Flask routing and request handling.
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Includes all CRUD operations, similar to Amazon Q, and manages the state of books well.
   - **Cons**: Lacks explicit ID handling in the POST method, assuming that the client sends a complete book object including a unique ID.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     # Copilot's solution assumes client-side responsibility for some data management tasks.
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Introduces explicit ID handling in the POST method which is a good practice for APIs.
   - **Cons**: Somewhat repetitive and verbose in the PUT and DELETE methods; could be optimized or simplified.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     # Gaia's code manually handles each field update in PUT requests, which might not be efficient for larger data structures.
     ```

### ChatGPT 4
   - **Pros**: Uses SQLAlchemy to manage a SQLite database, providing a more realistic and scalable solution.
   - **Cons**: More complex setup due to database integration, might be overkill for very simple or educational purposes.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     # This approach with a database integration is robust and suitable for real-world applications.
     ```

### Meta.ai
   - **Pros**: Simple and direct Flask API similar to other solutions but includes basic error handling in the form of 404 responses.
   - **Cons**: Like others, uses an in-memory list; also, the update method doesn't handle non-existing fields gracefully.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     # Meta's implementation is adequate for educational purposes but needs refinement for production use.
     ```

Certainly! Here's the analysis including Gemini's approach:

### Gemini
   - **Pros**: Introduces a structured and well-organized API setup that handles CRUD operations with clarity. The use of helper functions like `generate_id` and `find_book` improves code organization and reusability.
   - **Cons**: Still relies on an in-memory list, which limits its practicality for real-world applications where data persistence is key.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     # Gemini's approach is thoughtful, introducing utility functions that make the code cleaner and potentially easier to maintain.
     ```

## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **ChatGPT 4**'s use of SQLAlchemy for database integration still stands out for its scalability and robustness, making it suitable for real-world applications.

**Worst Implementation**: While all the solutions have their merits, **GitHub Copilot**'s approach is less ideal for production due to its assumption about client-side ID management, which can lead to data inconsistency and other issues.

**Notable Mention**: **Gemini** deserves a special mention for its clean code structure and thoughtful function decomposition, which enhances code readability and maintenance. Although it still uses in-memory storage, the setup provides a solid foundation for further development and integration with database systems for persistence.

# 9-data-manipulation-panda

# 9. Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Prompt

Write a Python script using Pandas to read a CSV file, filter out rows where the column 'Age' is over 50, and save the filtered data to a new CSV file.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('input_file.csv')

# Filter the DataFrame to keep rows where 'Age' is over 50
filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]


filtered_df.to_csv('output_file.csv', index=False)
```

Here's how the script works:

1. The `pd.read_csv('input_file.csv')` function reads the input CSV file and creates a Pandas DataFrame `df`.

1. The `df[df['Age'] <= 50]` expression filters the DataFrame to keep only the rows where the 'Age' column is less than or equal to 50.

1. The `filtered_df.to_csv('output_file.csv', index=False)` function writes the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file named 'output_file.csv'. The `index=False` parameter ensures that the row index is not included in the output file.

Make sure to replace 'input_file.csv' with the actual name of your input CSV file, and 'output_file.csv' with the desired name for the output file.

Note that this script assumes that your CSV file has a column named 'Age'. If the column name is different, you'll need to update the code accordingly.

### GitHub Copilot



```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('input_file.csv')

# Filter the DataFrame to keep rows where 'Age' is 50 or less
filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]

# Save the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file
filtered_df.to_csv('output_file.csv', index=False)
```

Please replace `'input_file.csv'` with the path to your input CSV file, and `'output_file.csv'` with the desired path for the output file.

### Axet Gaia


```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('input.csv')

# Filter out rows where 'Age' is over 50
filtered_data = data[data['Age'] <= 50]

# Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
filtered_data.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
```

**Explanation**

- We start by importing the `pandas` library, which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities.
- Next, we use the `read_csv` function from `pandas` to read the input CSV file and store it in the `data` variable.
- We then filter out rows where the 'Age' column is over 50 by using boolean indexing. This creates a new DataFrame called `filtered_data`.
- Finally, we use the `to_csv` function to save the `filtered_data` DataFrame to a new CSV file called 'output.csv', without including the index column.

This solution follows best practices in Python by using the `pandas` library for efficient data manipulation and by using clear and concise code.

### ChatGpt 4

Here's a Python script that uses the Pandas library to accomplish the task of reading a CSV file, filtering out rows where the 'Age' column values are over 50, and then saving the filtered data to a new CSV file. Make sure you have Pandas installed in your environment, which you can install via pip if you haven't already (`pip install pandas`).

```python
import pandas as pd

def filter_data(input_file, output_file):
    # Read the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv(input_file)

    # Filter out rows where 'Age' is greater than 50
    filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]

    # Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
    filtered_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

# Example usage
input_file = 'path_to_your_input_file.csv'
output_file = 'path_to_your_output_file.csv'
filter_data(input_file, output_file)
```
**How to Use This Script**

1. **Prepare Your CSV File**: Ensure your CSV file is correctly formatted and includes an 'Age' column. Place the CSV file in a known directory.
2. **Set File Paths**: Replace `'path_to_your_input_file.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file. Similarly, adjust `'path_to_your_output_file.csv'` to where you want the filtered data saved.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment. This can be done through a command line by running `python your_script_name.py` if saved in a file, or directly in a Python interactive environment.

This script is straightforward and efficient for filtering data based on age criteria. It's a common task in data preprocessing, making this script useful in various data analysis and machine learning preprocessing steps.

### Meta.ai

Here is a Python script using Pandas to achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('input.csv')

# Filter out rows where the 'Age' column is over 50
filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]

# Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
filtered_df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
```

Here's how the script works:

1. `pd.read_csv('input.csv') `reads the input CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
1. `df['Age'] <= 50` creates a boolean mask to filter out rows where the 'Age' column is greater than 50.
1. `df[...]` applies the filter to the DataFrame, resulting in a new DataFrame with only the rows where 'Age' is less than or equal to 50.
1. `filtered_df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)` saves the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file named 'output.csv'. The `index=False` parameter tells Pandas not to include the row indices in the output file.

Make sure to replace 'input.csv' with the path to your input CSV file, and the script will generate a new file named 'output.csv' in the same directory with the filtered data.

Note: This script assumes that the 'Age' column exists in the input CSV file and contains numerical values. If the column name or data type is different, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.

### Gemini


```python
import pandas as pd

# Define the input and output CSV filenames
input_file = "data.csv"  # Replace with your actual input CSV filename
output_file = "filtered_data.csv"  # Replace with your desired output filename

# Read the CSV file using Pandas
data = pd.read_csv(input_file)

# Filter the data where 'Age' is less than or equal to 50 (inclusive)
filtered_data = data[data["Age"] <= 50]

# Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
filtered_data.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

print(f"Data filtered and saved to: {output_file}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import Pandas:** We import the `pandas` library for data manipulation.
2. **Define Filenames:** Define the names of your input and output CSV files (replace with your actual filenames).
3. **Read CSV:** Use `pd.read_csv` to read the data from the input file into a pandas DataFrame named `data`.
4. **Filter Data:** We filter the DataFrame using boolean indexing. We select rows where the value in the "Age" column is less than or equal to 50 (`data["Age"] <= 50`). The filtered data is stored in the `filtered_data` DataFrame.
5. **Save Data:** Use the `to_csv` method on the `filtered_data` DataFrame to save it as a new CSV file with the specified name (`output_file`). The `index=False` argument ensures the row index is not included in the output.
6. **Print Message:** Print a confirmation message indicating the output filename.

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the script as a Python file (e.g., filter_data.py).
2. Make sure the input CSV file is in the same directory as your script.
3. Run the script from your terminal: `python filter_data.py`

This script will read the CSV data, filter by age, and save the filtered data to a new CSV file.  

## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Concise and effective script for reading, filtering, and saving data using Pandas.
   - **Cons**: No error handling or validation to ensure the 'Age' column exists.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Read the CSV file
     df = pd.read_csv('input_file.csv')

     # Filter the DataFrame to keep rows where 'Age' is 50 or less
     filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]

     # Save the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file
     filtered_df.to_csv('output_file.csv', index=False)
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Similar to Amazon Q, efficiently accomplishes the task using Pandas.
   - **Cons**: Like Amazon Q, lacks detailed comments and error handling.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Read the CSV file
     df = pd.read_csv('input_file.csv')

     # Filter the DataFrame to keep rows where 'Age' is 50 or less
     filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]

     # Save the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file
     filtered_df.to_csv('output_file.csv', index=False)
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Clear and detailed explanation of each step, maintaining simplicity.
   - **Cons**: Lacks advanced features or handling of potential exceptions.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Read the CSV file
     data = pd.read_csv('input.csv')

     # Filter out rows where 'Age' is over 50
     filtered_data = data[data['Age'] <= 50]

     # Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
     filtered_data.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
     ```

### ChatGPT 4
   - **Pros**: Encapsulates functionality in a reusable function, adding flexibility and clarity.
   - **Cons**: Could be considered slightly more complex than necessary for very simple tasks.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     def filter_data(input_file, output_file):
         # Read the CSV file
         df = pd.read_csv(input_file)

         # Filter out rows where 'Age' is greater than 50
         filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]

         # Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
         filtered_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
     ```

### Meta.ai
   - **Pros**: Direct implementation, straightforward and efficient.
   - **Cons**: Similar to others, lacks error handling or checks for data integrity.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Read the CSV file
     df = pd.read_csv('input.csv')

     # Filter out rows where 'Age' is over 50
     filtered_df = df[df['Age'] <= 50]

     # Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
     filtered_df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
     ```

### Gemini
   - **Pros**: Provides a complete and structured approach with clear file path definitions and use of global variables for ID management.
   - **Cons**: While detailed, the inclusion of global variables may not be necessary and could complicate understanding for beginners.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Define the input and output CSV filenames
     input_file = "data.csv"  # Replace with your actual input CSV filename
     output_file = "filtered_data.csv"  # Replace with your desired output filename

     # Read the CSV file using Pandas
     data = pd.read_csv(input_file)

     # Filter the data where 'Age' is less than or equal to 50 (inclusive)
     filtered_data = data[data["Age"] <= 50]

     # Save the filtered data to a new CSV file
     filtered_data.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

     print(f"Data filtered and saved to: {output_file}")
     ```

## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **ChatGPT 4** offers a well-rounded approach by encapsulating the filtering logic in a function, which not only clarifies the code's purpose but also makes it reusable in larger projects or different contexts. This method adds value by enhancing maintainability and scalability.

**Worst Implementation**: While none of the implementations are inherently poor, the simplicity and lack of error handling in **Meta.ai** and **Amazon Q** make them slightly less robust compared to the detailed approach by **ChatGPT 4**. These simpler scripts do not account for common data issues such as missing columns or incorrect data types, which could lead to runtime errors in practical applications.

  }
}

```

Here's how the CSS works:

1. The `.grid-container` class sets up the grid layout with a single column on the default (mobile) view.

1. The `@media (min-width: 768px)` media query targets tablet-sized screens and above. It changes the grid to have two columns.

1. The `@media (min-width: 992px)` media query targets desktop-sized screens and above. It changes the grid to have four columns.

1. The `grid-gap` property adds some spacing between the grid items.

You can use this CSS in your HTML structure like this:


```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 6</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 7</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 8</div>
</div>

```
This will create a responsive grid layout that adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size.

### GitHub Copilot

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 20px;
}

@media (max-width: 1024px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(400px, 1fr));
  }
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

In this CSS, `.grid-container` is the class for the grid container. The `grid-template-columns` property defines the number of columns in the grid. The `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr))` value means that the grid will have as many columns as can fit without any of them having a width less than 200px.

The `@media` rules define the breakpoints for tablet and mobile. When the viewport width is 1024px or less, the grid will have two columns, and when it is 600px or less, the grid will have one column. The `grid-gap` property defines the gap between the grid cells.

**Explanation**

- The `grid` class is used to define the grid container.
- The `grid-template-columns` property is used to define the number of columns in the grid.
- The `grid-gap` property is used to add spacing between grid items.
- Media queries are used to apply different styles based on the screen size.
- The `item` class is used to style the grid items.

Feel free to modify the code as needed and add more items to the grid. 

### ChatGpt 4

Here's an example of how you can define a responsive CSS grid layout that adapts to three breakpoints (mobile, tablet, and desktop). This layout will use four columns on desktop, two columns on tablet, and one column on mobile.

**CSS Code**
```css
/* Base styles for the grid container */
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    gap: 16px; /* Spacing between grid items */
    padding: 16px; /* Padding around the grid */
}

/* Mobile styles (default) */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    .grid-container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* One column layout */
    }
}

/* Tablet styles */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) {
    .grid-container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* Two columns layout */
    }
}

/* Desktop styles */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .grid-container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Four columns layout */
    }
}
```

**HTML Code**
To use this CSS, you will need an HTML structure like the following:
```html
<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 3</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 4</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 5</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 6</div>
    <!-- Add more items as needed -->
</div>
```

**Explanation**

1. **CSS Grid**: The `.grid-container` class defines the container that uses CSS Grid for layout.
2. **Gap and Padding**: Adjust the `gap` and `padding` to control the spacing inside and between the grid items.
3. **Breakpoints**:
   - **Mobile**: Applies when the screen width is 767px or less. The grid will have one column.
   - **Tablet**: Applies from 768px to 1023px. The grid changes to two columns.
   - **Desktop**: Applies from 1024px and above. The grid expands to four columns.

This approach uses CSS media queries to adapt the grid layout based on the screen size, ensuring a responsive and flexible design across different devices. Adjust the breakpoints and column settings as needed to fit your specific design requirements.

### Meta.ai

Here is an example of CSS for a responsive grid layout that adapts to three breakpoints:
```css
/* Mobile (default) */
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}

/* Tablet ( breakpoint at 768px ) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}

/* Desktop ( breakpoint at 1200px ) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  }
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #eee;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
Let me explain how this works:

- We define a container element with the class `grid-container` that will hold our grid items.
- By default (for mobile), we set the grid to have one column with a fractional unit of 1fr (meaning it will take up the full width of the container).
- We define two media queries for the tablet and desktop breakpoints. When the screen width reaches 768px (typical tablet width), we update the grid to have two columns, each taking up half the width (repeat(2, 1fr)). When the screen width reaches 1200px (typical desktop width), we update the grid to have four columns, each taking up a quarter of the width (repeat(4, 1fr)).
- The `.grid-item` class is applied to each item in the grid and adds some basic styling (background color and padding).
- 
You can apply this CSS to your HTML structure, which should look something like this:

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Grid item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Grid item 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Grid item 3</div>
  <!-- Add more grid items as needed -->
</div>
```
This responsive grid layout will adapt to the screen size, switching between a single column on mobile, two columns on tablet, and four columns on desktop.

```css
/* Base styles */
.grid-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin: 0 auto;  /* Center the grid horizontally */
  padding: 1rem;  /* Add some padding for spacing */
}

.grid-item {
  flex: 1 0 auto;  /* Flex equally within a row */
  padding: 0.5rem;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;  /* Add a border for better visualization */
  text-align: center;  /* Center content within grid items */
}


/* Media queries for breakpoints */
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) { /* Mobile (up to 768px) */
  .grid-container {
    justify-content: center;  /* Center items horizontally on mobile */
  }

  .grid-item {
    width: 100%;  /* Make each item take full width on mobile */
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 992px) { /* Tablet (768px to 992px) */
  .grid-item {
    width: 50%;  /* Make each item take half the width on tablet */
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 992px) { /* Desktop (over 992px) */
  .grid-item {
    width: 25%;  /* Make each item take a quarter of the width on desktop */
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Styles:**
   - `.grid-container`: Defines the container element for the grid. It uses `flex-wrap: wrap` to allow items to wrap onto multiple lines as needed.
   - `.grid-item`: Defines the individual grid items. It uses `flex: 1 0 auto` to make items flexible and share available space equally within a row.

2. **Media Queries:**
   - We use three media queries to target different screen sizes:
      - Mobile (up to 768px): Makes the grid container centered horizontally and each item takes full width.
      - Tablet (768px to 992px): Makes each item take half the width of the container.
      - Desktop (over 992px): Makes each item take a quarter of the width of the container (four columns).

**Usage:**

Wrap your grid items with the `.grid-item` class and enclose them within a container element with the `.grid-container` class. This CSS will create a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

**Note:**

- You can adjust the breakpoints (screen sizes) and column widths based on your specific design requirements. 
- This code provides a simple starting point, and you can further customize it with additional styles like margins, backgrounds, and responsive font sizes.


## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Provides a clear and straightforward implementation of the CSS grid with explicit breakpoints. It efficiently sets up the grid with single, double, and quadruple column configurations as the viewport widens.
   - **Cons**: It lacks additional styling details for the `.grid-item`, which might leave the implementation slightly abstract without visual context.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```css
     .grid-container {
       display: grid;
       grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);
       grid-gap: 20px;
     }
     @media (min-width: 768px) {
       .grid-container {
         grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
       }
     }
     @media (min-width: 992px) {
       .grid-container {
         grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
       }
     }
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Uses a dynamic approach with `auto-fill` and `minmax`, allowing the grid to adjust the number of columns based on the container's width and the minimum size of the items.
   - **Cons**: The use of `max-width` in media queries might be confusing, as it reverses the mobile-first approach typically recommended for responsive design.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```css
     .grid-container {
       display: grid;
       grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
       grid-gap: 20px;
     }
     @media (max-width: 1024px) {
       .grid-container {
         grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(400px, 1fr));
       }
     }
     @media (max-width: 600px) {
       .grid-container {
         grid-template-columns: 1fr;
       }
     }
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Provides a full HTML and CSS example which is immediately testable and visually demonstrative. It covers mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints clearly.
   - **Cons**: The inclusion of HTML might distract from the core CSS grid layout task, making the example more verbose than necessary.

     ```css
     .grid {
       display: grid;
       grid-template-columns: 1fr;
       grid-gap: 10px;
     }
     @media (min-width: 600px) {
       .grid {
         grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
       }
     }
     @media (min-width: 1024px) {
       .grid {
         grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
       }
     }
     ```

### ChatGPT 4
   - **Pros**: Offers a detailed and instructive setup, including base, mobile, tablet, and desktop-specific rules. It uses a mobile-first approach and includes padding and gap specifications for practical use.
   - **Cons**: Might be considered verbose for simple tasks but is very educational and practical for real-world applications.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```css

     }
     @media (min-width: 1200px) {
       .grid-container {
         grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
       }
     }
     ```

### Gemini
   - **Pros**: Introduces a flex-based approach, offering an alternative to the typical CSS Grid method. It provides a

 flexible and straightforward method of adjusting the layout across various screen sizes using flex properties.
   - **Cons**: As it deviates from the grid-based prompt by using flexbox, it might not directly answer the requirement for a grid layout but offers a robust alternative.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```css
     .grid-container {
       display: flex;
       flex-wrap: wrap;
       margin: 0 auto;
       padding: 1rem;
     }
     .grid-item {
       flex: 1 0 auto;
       padding: 0.5rem;
       border: 1px solid #ddd;
       text-align: center;
     }
     @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
       .grid-item {
         width: 100%;
       }
     }
     @media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 992px) {
       .grid-item {
         width: 50%;
       }
     }
     @media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
       .grid-item {
         width: 25%;
       }
     }
     ```

## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **ChatGPT 4** offers the most comprehensive and educational example that balances detailed explanations with practical CSS grid setup, making it ideal for learners and developers seeking to understand responsive design deeply.

**Worst Implementation**: While **GitHub Copilot** provides an innovative solution with `auto-fill` and `minmax`, it might be seen as less aligned with the explicit needs of the prompt due to its reverse breakpoints and less direct approach to specified grid configurations.

# 11-sql-query

# 11. SQL Query

## Prompt

Write an SQL query to select the top 10 highest earning employees from a table named 'Employees' that includes columns for 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary'.

## Results


### Amazon Q

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will:

1. Select the 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary' columns from the 'Employees' table.

1. Order the results by the 'salary' column in descending order, so the highest salaries are first.

1. Limit the results to the top 10 rows.

The key points are:

- The `ORDER BY salary DESC` clause sorts the results by the 'salary' column in descending order, so the highest salaries are first.

- The `LIMIT 10` clause limits the results to the top 10 rows.

This will return the 10 employees with the highest salaries, along with their 'employee_id' and 'name'.


### GitHub Copilot


```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will select the 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary' columns from the 'Employees' table, order the results in descending order by the 'salary' column (highest to lowest), and limit the results to the top 10.

### Axet Gaia

To select the top 10 highest earning employees from a table named 'Employees' that includes columns for 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary', you can use the following SQLite query:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query selects the 'employee_id', 'name', and 'salary' columns from the 'Employees' table. It then orders the result set in descending order based on the 'salary' column. Finally, it limits the result set to the top 10 rows.


### ChatGpt 4

Here is an SQL query that selects the top 10 highest earning employees from a table named `Employees`. This table includes columns for `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`. The query sorts the employees by their salary in descending order and limits the results to the top 10:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Breakdown of the SQL Query**

1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary` to be retrieved from the `Employees` table.

2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates that the data should be fetched from the `Employees` table.

3. **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts the results by the `salary` column in descending order (`DESC`), which ensures that the employees with the highest salaries are listed first.

4. **LIMIT Clause**: Restricts the output to only the top 10 rows, which corresponds to the top 10 highest earning employees.

This query will effectively retrieve the top 10 highest paid employees, showing their ID, name, and salary. Make sure your database supports the `LIMIT` clause, as SQL syntax can vary slightly between systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others. For instance, in SQL Server, you would use `SELECT TOP 10` instead of `LIMIT 10`.

### Meta.ai

Here is the SQL query to select the top 10 highest earning employees:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's how the query works:

- `SELECT *` selects all columns (`employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`) from the Employees table.
- `ORDER BY salary DESC` sorts the results in descending order based on the `salary` column, so the highest earners come first.
- `LIMIT 10` restricts the output to the top 10 results, so we only get the 10 highest earning employees.
  
This query assumes that the salary column is of a numeric data type (such as INT or DECIMAL) and that you want to include all columns in the output. If you only want to include specific columns, you can replace * with the column names, like this:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will give you the `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary` of the top 10 highest earning employees.

### Gemini


```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT:** This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the table. Here, we select `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`.
2. **FROM:** This clause specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data. Here, we use `Employees`.
3. **ORDER BY salary DESC:** This clause sorts the results in descending order based on the `salary` column. This ensures the highest earners appear first.
4. **LIMIT 10:** This clause limits the number of rows returned to the top 10 results.

This query retrieves the `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary` for the top 10 employees with the highest salaries in the `Employees` table.

# 12-react-component

# 12. React Component

## Prompt

Generate a React functional component named 'UserProfile' that accepts 'username' and 'age' as props and displays them. Include PropTypes validation for both props.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```js
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const UserProfile = ({ username, age }) => {

1. Inside the component, we render the user's `username` and `age` using JSX.

1. We define the `propTypes`
 object for the `UserProfile` component, which specifies the expected types for the `username` and `age` props. In this case, `username` is a required string, and `age` is a required number.

1. Finally, we export the `UserProfile` component so it can be used in other parts of the application.

To use this `UserProfile` component, you can do something like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserProfile username="John Doe" age={35} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This will render the `UserProfile` component with the provided `username` and `age` props.


### GitHub Copilot


```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const UserProfile = ({ username, age }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{username}</h2>
            <p>{age}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

UserProfile.propTypes = {
    username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
};

export default UserProfile;
```

In this code, `UserProfile` is a functional component that takes `username` and `age` as props and displays them in a `div`. The `propTypes` property is used to validate the props. It checks that `username` is a string and `age` is a number, and both are required.

### Axet Gaia

Sure! Here's the React code for implementing the 'UserProfile' component with PropTypes validation:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const UserProfile = ({ username, age }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      <p>Username: {username}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

UserProfile.propTypes = {
  username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
};

export default UserProfile;
```

**Explanation**

- We import React and PropTypes from their respective packages.
- We define a functional component named 'UserProfile' that accepts 'username' and 'age' as props.
- Inside the component, we return JSX code that displays the username and age.
- We use PropTypes to validate that the 'username' prop is a string and the 'age' prop is a number. Both props are also marked as required.

This solution follows best practices for React by using functional components, destructuring props, and using PropTypes for prop validation.


### ChatGpt 4

Here's a React functional component named `UserProfile` that accepts `username` and `age` as props and displays them. This example includes PropTypes validation to ensure that the props are of the expected types. To use PropTypes in your React project, you'll need to ensure that the PropTypes library is installed, which you can add via npm or yarn if it's not already included in your project.

First, make sure you have PropTypes installed:
```bash
npm install prop-types
```

Then, here is the component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

function UserProfile({ username, age }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>User Profile</h1>
            <p>Username: {username}</p>
            <p>Age: {age}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

UserProfile.propTypes = {
    username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
};

export default UserProfile;
```

**Explanation**

1. **Importing Dependencies**: The component imports React and PropTypes. PropTypes is used to validate the types of the properties the component receives.
   
2. **Functional Component**: `UserProfile` is a functional component that takes `props` as its argument. It destructures `props` to get `username` and `age`.

3. **Rendering**: Inside the return statement, the component renders a `div` containing an `h1` tag for the title and two `p` tags displaying the `username` and `age`.

4. **PropTypes Validation**: The component uses PropTypes to ensure `username` is a string and `age` is a number, both of which are marked as required. This means the component will throw a warning in the console during development if these props are not provided or if they are provided with incorrect types.

This setup helps ensure that the component is used correctly within a larger application, promoting type safety and reducing runtime errors due to unexpected prop types.

### Meta.ai

Here is a React functional component named 'UserProfile' that accepts 'username' and 'age' as props and displays them:

```js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const UserProfile = ({ username, age }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      <p>Username: {username}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

UserProfile.propTypes = {
  username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
};

export default UserProfile;
```

Here's what's happening:

- We define a functional component UserProfile that takes username and age as props.
- We use destructuring to extract the props from the component's arguments.
- We return a div element containing an h1 heading and two p elements that display the username and age props.
- We import PropTypes from the prop-types package and define the prop types for username and age using the PropTypes object.
- We specify that both username and age are required props using the isRequired modifier.
- Finally, we export the UserProfile component as the default export of the module.
- 
With this component, you can pass username and age props like this:

```jsx
<UserProfile username="johnDoe" age={30} />
```

And it will display:

```bash
User Profile
Username: johnDoe
Age: 30
```

Note that if you don't pass the required props, React will throw a warning.

### Gemini


```jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'prop-types';

const UserProfile = ({ username, age }) => {
  // Prop validation using PropTypes
  UserProfile.propTypes = {
    username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      <p>Username: {username}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Imports:** We import `React` and `PropTypes` from `prop-types`.
2. **Functional Component:** We define a functional component named `UserProfile` that takes two props: `username` and `age`.
3. **PropTypes Validation:**
   - We define a static property on the component named `propTypes`.
   - Inside `propTypes`, we use property type validators from `PropTypes`:
     - `username`: We specify that `username` should be a string and is required (`isRequired`).
     - `age`: We specify that `age` should be a number and is required (`isRequired`).
4. **JSX:**
   - The component returns JSX that displays the user profile information.
   - We access the props using curly braces `{}`.
5. **Export:** We export the `UserProfile` component using `export default`.

**Usage:**

```jsx
import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserProfile username="John Doe" age={30} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example usage, the `UserProfile` component receives valid props (`username` as a string and `age` as a number). If you pass invalid props (e.g., non-string username or non-number age), React will display warnings in development mode due to the PropTypes validation.

**Note:**

- This example uses `PropTypes` from the `prop-types` package. In newer React versions, consider using TypeScript or a linter with PropType definitions for improved type safety and developer experience.

# 13-sorting-algorithm

# 13. Sorting Algorithm

## Prompt

Implement a `quicksort` algorithm in Typescript that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```typescript

function quickSort(arr: number[]): number[] {
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }

  const pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];
  const left = [];
  const right = [];
  const middle = [];

  for (const item of arr) {
    if (item < pivot) {
      left.push(item);
    } else if (item > pivot) {
      right.push(item);
    } else {
      middle.push(item);
    }
  }

  return [...quickSort(left), ...middle, ...quickSort(right)];
}

// Example usage
const unsortedArray = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3, 8, 4, 6];
const sortedArray = quickSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Here's how the `quickSort` function works:

1. If the input array has 0 or 1 elements, it is already sorted, so we return the array as is.
2. We choose the middle element of the array as the pivot.
3. We create three empty arrays: `left`, `right`, and `middle`. We'll use these to partition the input array based on the pivot.
4. We loop through the input array and add each element to the appropriate partition array based on its comparison to the pivot.
5. We recursively call `quickSort` on the left` and `right` partitions, and then concatenate the sorted `left`, `middle`, and `right` partitions to get the final sorted array.

The time complexity of `quicksort` is O(n log n) on average, but it can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case (when the array is already sorted or reverse-sorted). The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursive calls.

### GitHub Copilot

1. Define a function `quicksort` that takes an array of numbers as input.
2. If the array length is less than or equal to 1, return the array as it is already sorted.
3. Choose a pivot element from the array. This can be the first, last, or middle element.
4. Create two empty arrays: `less` and `greater`.
5. Iterate over the array, excluding the pivot. If an element is less than the pivot, push it to the `less` array. If it's greater, push it to the `greater` array.
6. Recursively apply the `quicksort` function to both `less` and `greater` arrays.
7. Concatenate the sorted `less` array, pivot, and sorted `greater` array to get the sorted array.

Here is the TypeScript code implementing the above plan:

```typescript
function quicksort(array: number[]): number[] {
    if (array.length <= 1) {
        return array;
    }

    const pivot = array[array.length - 1];
    const left = [];
    const right = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
        if (array[i] < pivot) {
            left.push(array[i]);
        } else {
            right.push(array[i]);
        }
    }

    return [...quicksort(left), pivot, ...quicksort(right)];
}
```

You can use this function to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

### Axet Gaia

Sure! Here's the JavaScript code for implementing the quicksort algorithm in TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Quicksort algorithm implementation in TypeScript.
 * Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
 * @param arr - The array to be sorted.
 * @returns The sorted array.
 */
function quicksort(arr: number[]): number[] {
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }

  const pivot = arr[arr.length - 1];
  const left = [];
  const right = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < pivot) {
      left.push(arr[i]);
    } else {
      right.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  return [...quicksort(left), pivot, ...quicksort(right)];
}

// Example usage:
const unsortedArray = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7];
const sortedArray = quicksort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]
```

**Explanation**

- The `quicksort` function takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array.
- If the array has only one element or is empty, it is already sorted, so we return it as is.
- We choose the last element of the array as the pivot.
- We create two empty arrays, `left` and `right`, to store the elements smaller and larger than the pivot, respectively.
- We iterate through the array, comparing each element to the pivot and pushing it into the appropriate array.
- Finally, we recursively call `quicksort` on the `left` and `right` arrays, and concatenate the sorted arrays with the pivot in between.

This implementation follows best practices for JavaScript, such as using `const` for variables that don't need to be reassigned, using arrow functions for concise code, and using TypeScript for type safety.

### ChatGpt 4

Below is an implementation of the Quicksort algorithm in TypeScript. This version of Quicksort uses the Lomuto partition scheme, which is a common method to choose the pivot element at the end of the array segment being sorted. This example demonstrates how to sort an array of integers in ascending order:

```typescript
function quicksort(array: number[], low: number, high: number): void {
    if (low < high) {
        let pivotIndex = partition(array, low, high);
        quicksort(array, low, pivotIndex - 1);
        quicksort(array, pivotIndex + 1, high);
    }
}

function partition(array: number[], low: number, high: number): number {
    const pivot = array[high];
    let i = low - 1;

    for (let j = low; j < high; j++) {
        if (array[j] < pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(array, i, j);
        }
    }
    swap(array, i + 1, high);
    return i + 1;
}

function swap(array: number[], index1: number, index2: number): void {
    const temp = array[index1];
    array[index1] = array[index2];
    array[index2] = temp;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5];
quicksort(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
console.log("Sorted array:", arr);
```

**Explanation**

- **quicksort function**: This is a recursive function that continues to sort the subarrays. It takes the array to be sorted, and the `low` and `high` indices as parameters, representing the current segment of the array that needs to be sorted.
- **partition function**: This function rearranges the elements in the current segment of the array based on their comparison with the pivot element. All elements less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot, and all greater elements are moved to the right.
- **swap function**: A helper function that swaps two elements in the array.
- **Example Usage**: The `arr` array is defined, and `quicksort` is called on it. After the sort, the array is logged to the console in its sorted order.

This Quicksort implementation is a classic example of divide-and-conquer algorithms, providing efficient average-case performance and is widely used in various applications.

### Meta.ai

Here is a TypeScript implementation of the quicksort algorithm:

```typescript
function quicksort(arr: number[]): number[] {
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }

  const pivot = arr[0];
  const less = [];
  const greater = [];

  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] <= pivot) {
      less.push(arr[i]);
    } else {
      greater.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  return [...quicksort(less), pivot, ...quicksort(greater)];
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4];
const sortedArr = quicksort(arr);
console.log(sortedArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
```

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

- The `quicksort` function takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.
- If the input array has only one element or is empty, we return it as it is already sorted.
- We choose the first element as the pivot.
- We create two arrays, less and greater, to store elements `less` `than` and `greater` than the pivot, respectively.
- We iterate through the input array, starting from the second element (index 1), and distribute elements into less and greater arrays based on their comparison with the pivot.
- We recursively call quicksort on less and greater arrays and concatenate the results with the pivot element in the middle.
- The spread operator (...) is used to flatten the recursive calls into a single array.
  
Note that this implementation uses the Lomuto partition scheme, which is a variation of the standard Hoare partition scheme that is slightly faster and more efficient in practice.

### Gemini


```typescript
function quicksort(arr: number[], low: number = 0, high: number = arr.length - 1): void {
  if (low < high) {
    const pivot = partition(arr, low, high);
    quicksort(arr, low, pivot - 1);
    quicksort(arr, pivot + 1, high);
  }
}

function partition(arr: number[], low: number, high: number): number {
  const pivot = arr[high];
  let i = low - 1;

  for (let j = low; j < high; j++) {
    if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
      i++;
      [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
    }
  }

  [arr[i + 1], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i + 1]];
  return i + 1;
}

// Example usage
const unsortedArray = [5, 3, 8, 2, 1, 4];
quicksort(unsortedArray);
console.log(unsortedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`quicksort` function:**
   - Takes an array of integers (`arr`), optional `low` and `high` indices (defaults to 0 and array length - 1).
   - Base case: If `low` is greater than or equal to `high`, the subarray is empty or has one element, so it's already sorted.
   - Recursive case:
     - Calls the `partition` function to choose a pivot element and partition the array around it.
     - Recursively sorts the left subarray (elements less than the pivot) from `low` to `pivot - 1`.
     - Recursively sorts the right subarray (elements greater than or equal to the pivot) from `pivot + 1` to `high`.

2. **`partition` function:**
   - Takes the array, `low`, and `high` indices.
   - Selects the last element (`arr[high]`) as the pivot.
   - Initializes a variable `i` to `low - 1` (index before the first element considered for swapping).
   - Loops through the array from `low` to `high - 1` (excluding the pivot):
     - If the current element (`arr[j]`) is less than or equal to the pivot, it belongs to the left subarray:
       - Increment `i`.
       - Swap the elements at `i` and `j`.
   - After the loop, the pivot element is in its final sorted position (`i + 1`). Swap the pivot with the element at `i + 1`.
   - Returns the index (`i + 1`) where the pivot is placed.

3. **Example Usage:**
   - Demonstrates how to call the `quicksort` function and print the sorted array.

**Note:**

- This implementation uses the first element (`arr[high]`) as the pivot. You can choose different pivot selection strategies (e.g., median-of-three) for potentially better performance in certain cases.
- Quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) but can have a worst-case complexity of O(n^2) for already sorted or nearly sorted arrays. Consider using a different sorting algorithm for such cases. 



## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Implements the Quicksort algorithm effectively using a clear and common approach with the middle element as the pivot, which can help in balancing the partitions more evenly in varied datasets.
   - **Cons**: The specific choice of pivot (middle element) might not always prevent worst-case performance (O(n^2)) when the array is nearly sorted.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```typescript
     function quickSort(arr: number[]): number[] {
       if (arr.length <= 1) {
         return arr;
       }

       const pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];
       const left = [];
       const right = [];
       const middle = [];

       for (const item of arr) {
         if (item < pivot) {
           left.push(item);
         } else if (item > pivot) {
           right.push(item);
         } else {
           middle.push(item);
         }
       }

       return [...quickSort(left), ...middle, ...quickSort(right)];
     }
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Provides a straightforward implementation of the Quicksort algorithm that is easy to understand and use.
   - **Cons**: The pivot selection (last element) can lead to inefficient sorting (O(n^2)) under certain conditions, like already sorted arrays.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```typescript
     function quicksort(array: number[]): number[] {
       if (array.length <= 1) {
           return array;
       }

       const pivot = array[array.length - 1];
       const left = [];
       const right = [];

       for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
           if (array[i] < pivot) {
               left.push(array[i]);
           } else {
               right.push(array[i]);
           }
       }

       return [...quicksort(left), pivot, ...quicksort(right)];
     }
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Provides a clear and well-commented implementation of the Quicksort algorithm that adheres to TypeScript standards.
   - **Cons**: Similar to GitHub Copilot’s solution, the pivot selection could lead to less optimal performance in worst-case scenarios.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```typescript
     function quicksort(arr: number[]): number[] {
       if (arr.length <= 1) {
         return arr;
       }

       const pivot = arr[arr.length - 1];
       const left = [];
       const right = [];

       for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
         if (arr[i] < pivot) {
           left.push(arr[i]);
         } else {
           right.push(arr[i]);
         }
       }

       return [...quicksort(left), pivot, ...quicksort(right)];
     }
     ```

### ChatGpt 4
   - **Pros**: Offers a detailed and traditional implementation of Quicksort, including in-place partitioning, which saves memory and is closer to the algorithm’s original intent.
   - **Cons**: The manual management of array indices can increase complexity and risk of errors; not using additional arrays for partitioning might be harder to understand for beginners.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```typescript
     function quicksort(array: number[], low: number, high: number): void {
         if (low < high) {
             let pivotIndex = partition(array, low, high);
             quicksort(array, low, pivotIndex - 1);
             quicksort(array, pivotIndex + 1, high);
         }
     }

     function partition(array: number[], low: number, high: number): number {
         const pivot = array[high];
         let i = low - 1;

         for (let j = low; j < high; j++) {
             if (array[j] < pivot) {
                 i++;
                 swap(array, i, j);
             }
         }
         swap(array, i + 1, high);
         return i + 1;
     }

     function swap(array: number[], index1: number, index2: number): void {
         const temp = array[index1];
         array[index1] = array[index2];
         array[index2] = temp;
     }
     ```

### Meta.ai
   - **Pros**: Simplifies the implementation by always using the first element as the pivot, which is intuitive and easy to understand.
   - **Cons**: Using the first element as the pivot could lead to poor performance on already sorted or nearly sorted data.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```typescript
     function quicksort(arr: number[]): number[] {
       if (arr.length <= 1) {
         return arr;
       }

       const pivot = arr[0];
       const less = [];
       const greater = [];

       for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {


         if (arr[i] <= pivot) {
           less.push(arr[i]);
         } else {
           greater.push(arr[i]);
         }
       }

       return [...quicksort(less), pivot, ...quicksort(greater)];
     }
     ```

### Gemini
   - **Pros**: Offers a concise implementation using Lomuto’s partition scheme which is generally easier to implement and understand than Hoare's partitioning.
   - **Cons**: The selection of the last element as the pivot can be problematic for already sorted arrays leading to O(n^2) time complexity.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```typescript
     function quicksort(arr: number[], low: number = 0, high: number = arr.length - 1): void {
       if (low < high) {
         const pivot = partition(arr, low, high);
         quicksort(arr, low, pivot - 1);
         quicksort(arr, pivot + 1, high);
       }
     }

     function partition(arr: number[], low: number, high: number): number {
       const pivot = arr[high];
       let i = low - 1;

       for (let j = low; j < high; j++) {
         if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
           i++;
           [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
         }
       }

       [arr[i + 1], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i + 1]];
       return i + 1;
     }
     ```

## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **ChatGpt 4** offers the most robust and traditionally accurate implementation of Quicksort, using in-place swapping which is more memory efficient and closer to the original algorithm.

**Worst Implementation**: While there isn’t a clear "worst" since all solutions effectively implement Quicksort, the implementations like **Meta.ai** and **Gemini** that consistently use the first or last element as a pivot might not perform optimally on already sorted or nearly sorted data.

# 14-unit-test-jest

# 14. Unit Test with Jest

## Prompt

Write a Jest test for a JavaScript function named 'multiply' that takes two parameters and returns their product. The test should check if the function correctly multiplies 3 by 5.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```js

// multiply.js
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

module.exports = multiply;

// multiply.test.js
const multiply = require('./multiply');

test('multiplies 3 by 5', () => {
  expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
});

```

Here's how the test works:

We define a `multiply` function in the `multiply.js` file that takes two parameters and returns their product.

We export the `multiply` function so that it can be used in other files.

In the `multiply.test.js` file, we import the `multiply` function using `require('./multiply')`.

We use the `test` function provided by Jest to define a test case. The first argument is a string that describes the test, and the second argument is a function that contains the actual test.

Inside the test function, we use the `expect` function provided by Jest to make an assertion about the output of the `multiply` function. In this case, we expect the result of `multiply(3, 5)` to be `15`.

To run the test, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
npx jest multiply.test.js
```

This will run the test and display the results. If the test passes, you should see output similar to the following:

```
 PASS  ./multiply.test.js
  ✓ multiplies 3 by 5 (2 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.178 s
Ran all test suites.

```

### GitHub Copilot


```javascript
// Assuming that the multiply function is defined in the same file
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// Jest test
describe('multiply', () => {
  test('correctly multiplies 3 by 5', () => {
    expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
  });
});
```

If the 'multiply' function is defined in a different module, you would need to import it into your test file:

```javascript
// Assuming that the multiply function is defined in a module named 'mathFunctions'
const { multiply } = require('./mathFunctions');

// Jest test
describe('multiply', () => {
  test('correctly multiplies 3 by 5', () => {
    expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
  });
});
```

### Axet Gaia

Sure! Here's the JavaScript code for implementing the 'multiply' function and writing a Jest test for it:

```javascript
// Function to multiply two numbers
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// Jest test for the multiply function
test('multiply function should correctly multiply 3 by 5', () => {
  // Arrange
  const num1 = 3;
  const num2 = 5;
  
  // Act
  const result = multiply(num1, num2);
  
  // Assert
  expect(result).toBe(15);
});
```

**Explanation**

- The `multiply` function takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns their product using the `*` operator.
- The Jest test is written using the `test` function provided by Jest. It checks if the `multiply` function correctly multiplies 3 by 5 by comparing the result with the expected value using the `expect` function and the `toBe` matcher.

This code follows best practices for JavaScript by:

- Using descriptive function and variable names (`multiply`, `num1`, `num2`, `result`) to improve code readability.
- Separating the function implementation and the test code into separate sections for better organization.
- Using comments to provide short explanations of the code's purpose and functionality.

### ChatGpt 4

To write a Jest test for a JavaScript function named `multiply` that multiplies two parameters, you'll first need a function implementation and then the corresponding test. Below, I provide both the function definition and the Jest test case.

**Step 1: Function Implementation**

Create a file named `multiply.js` and define the `multiply` function as follows:

```javascript
// multiply.js
function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

module.exports = multiply;
```

**Step 2: Writing Jest Test**

Create a test file named `multiply.test.js`. This file will contain the Jest test case to ensure that the `multiply` function works as expected, particularly that it correctly multiplies 3 by 5.

```javascript
// multiply.test.js
const multiply = require('./multiply');

describe('multiply function tests', () => {
    test('multiplies 3 and 5 to get 15', () => {
        expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
    });
});
```

**Explanation**

- **Require Statement**: The `multiply` function is imported from the `multiply.js` file.
- **describe block**: Used to group together similar tests. In this case, all tests related to the `multiply` function are grouped.
- **test block**: Defines a single test. The description inside the test function explains what the test is expected to do — in this case, check if `multiply(3, 5)` returns 15.
- **expect and toBe**: `expect` is the Jest method used to test a value. `toBe` is a matcher that tests for exact equality, meaning it checks if `multiply(3, 5)` returns exactly 15.

**Running the Test**

To run this test, you'll need Node.js and Jest installed. If Jest is not installed, you can add it by running:
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Add the following script to your `package.json` to make running tests easier:
```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
}
```

Now, you can run the test by executing:
```bash
npm test
```

This setup will execute the Jest test runner, which will find your test in `multiply.test.js` and run it, reporting whether the test passed or failed based on the criteria you've set. This simple test ensures that your multiplication logic in the `multiply` function is correct for the given inputs.

### Meta.ai

Here is a Jest test for the multiply function:
```js
import { multiply } from './multiply';

describe('multiply', () => {
  it('returns the product of two numbers', () => {
    expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
  });
});
```
Here's what's happening:

- We import the `multiply` function from the `./multiply` module (assuming it's in the same directory).
- We define a test suite named multiply using the `describe` function from Jest.
- We define a test case named `returns` the `product` of `two numbers` using the it function from Jest.
- We call the `multiply` function with arguments 3 and 5 and expect the result to be 15 using the expect function from Jest.
- We use the toBe matcher to check if the result is equal to 15.

When you run this test with Jest, it will pass if the multiply function correctly returns the product of 3 and 5, which is 15.
Note: Make sure to replace ./multiply with the actual path to your multiply function module.

### Gemini


```javascript
test('multiply function multiplies two numbers correctly', () => {
  const result = multiply(3, 5);
  expect(result).toBe(15);
});

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`test` function:** We use the `test` function from Jest to define a test case.
2. **Test Description:** The first argument to `test` is a string describing what the test is verifying.
3. **Test Body:** The second argument is a callback function that contains the actual test logic.
   - We call the `multiply` function with arguments 3 and 5 and store the result in a variable `result`.
   - We use the `expect` function from Jest to make assertions about the result.
   - In this case, we expect the `result` to be equal to 15 using the `toBe` matcher.

4. **`multiply` Function:** This function is defined outside the test but needs to be available for the test to run. It simply multiplies the two arguments and returns the product. 

**Running the Test:**

Save this code in a file (e.g., multiply.test.js). You can run Jest from the terminal using `npm test` or `yarn test` (assuming you have Jest configured in your project). 

If the `multiply` function works as expected, the test should pass. If there's an error or the function doesn't return the correct result, the test will fail and provide information about the failure.


## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Clear and simple implementation. Includes both the function definition and the test in a very straightforward format.
   - **Cons**: Minimal context or advanced Jest features used, but sufficient for the task.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     // multiply.js
     function multiply(a, b) {
       return a * b;
     }
     module.exports = multiply;

     // multiply.test.js
     const multiply = require('./multiply');
     test('multiplies 3 by 5', () => {
       expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
     });
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Similar to Amazon Q but introduces `describe` block for better organization of tests which is useful for larger test suites.
   - **Cons**: Slightly more verbose due to the `describe` block but no real cons for the complexity of the task.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     describe('multiply', () => {
       test('correctly multiplies 3 by 5', () => {
         expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
       });
     });
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Provides a clear explanation of the test structure and good use of Jest testing syntax. It also outlines the setup (`Arrange`), execution (`Act`), and assertion (`Assert`) phases explicitly which is good for understanding and maintaining tests.
   - **Cons**: Slightly verbose for a simple function test but beneficial for educational purposes.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     test('multiply function should correctly multiply 3 by 5', () => {
       const num1 = 3;
       const num2 = 5;
       const result = multiply(num1, num2);
       expect(result).toBe(15);
     });
     ```

### ChatGPT 4
   - **Pros**: Comprehensive setup with complete instructions for setting up Jest, which is helpful for beginners. Uses modern JavaScript syntax with ES6 module imports.
   - **Cons**: Requires changes in project setup (like modifying `package.json`) which may not be necessary just for one test.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     describe('multiply function tests', () => {
       test('multiplies 3 and 5 to get 15', () => {
         expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
       });
     });
     ```

### Meta.ai
   - **Pros**: Simple and concise, using modern JavaScript import statements, assuming ES6 modules are enabled.
   - **Cons**: Less detail in terms of setup and execution which might be needed for complete beginners.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```javascript
     import { multiply } from './multiply';
     describe('multiply', () => {
       it('returns the product of two numbers', () => {
         expect(multiply(3, 5)).toBe(15);
       });
     });
     ```

### Gemini

- **Pros**: Gemini's test is exceptionally straightforward, combining the function definition and test in one file for easy readability and quick testing.
 - **Cons**: The lack of modularity, with the function and test combined, could complicate maintenance and scalability in larger projects.
 - **Code Example**:
   ```javascript
      test('multiply function multiplies two numbers correctly', () => {
      const result = multiply(3, 5);
      expect(result).toBe(15);
    });

    function multiply(a, b) {
      return a * b;
    }
   ```


## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **ChatGpt 4** offers a comprehensive guide that is very useful for beginners, providing detailed steps and a complete setup guide, making it easy to understand and implement.

**Worst Implementation**: Although there isn't a "worst" since all solutions effectively fulfill the task, the **Gemini** approach could be considered less suitable for professional or larger scale projects due to its lack of modularity and direct inclusion of business logic within the test file, potentially complicating future scalability and maintenance.


# 15-dockerfile-configuration

# 15. Dockerfile Configuration

## Prompt

Create a Dockerfile for a Node.js application that uses an official Node image, copies the local files to the container, installs dependencies, and starts the server.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files into the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the application's dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy the application's source code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port on which the application will run
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
Here's how the Dockerfile works: 

1. The `FROM node:14` instruction specifies that we're using the official Node.js 14 image as the base image for our container.

1. The `WORKDIR /app` instruction sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.

1. The `COPY package*.json ./` instruction copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files from the local machine into the container's working directory.

1. The `RUN npm ci` instruction installs the application's dependencies using the `npm ci` command, which is a faster and more reliable alternative to `npm install`.

1. The `COPY . .` instruction copies the entire application source code from the local machine into the container's working directory.

1. The `EXPOSE 3000` instruction informs Docker that the container will listen on port 3000.

1. The `CMD ["npm", "start"]` instruction specifies the command that will be executed when a container is started from the image, which is to run `npm start` to start the Node.js server.

To build the Docker image using this Dockerfile, save the file in your project directory and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```
This will create a Docker image with the tag `my-node-app`. You can then run the container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```
This will start the container and map port 3000 on the host machine to port 3000 inside the container, allowing you to access the running Node.js application.


### GitHub Copilot


```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the application's dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the application source code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Inform Docker that the container will listen on port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Specify the command to run when the container starts
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

This Dockerfile uses the official Node.js image as the base, sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the container, installs the dependencies using `npm ci`, copies the rest of the application code, exposes port 3000, and specifies that `npm start` should be run when the container starts.


### Axet Gaia



```Dockerfile

// Use an official Node.js image as the base
FROM node:latest

// Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

// Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

// Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

// Copy the local files to the container
COPY . .

// Expose the port on which the server will run
EXPOSE 3000

// Start the server
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

In this code, we start by using the official Node.js image as the base for our Docker container. We then set the working directory to `/app` in the container.

Next, we copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the container. This allows us to install the dependencies specified in these files.

After that, we run the `npm install` command to install the dependencies.

We then copy all the local files to the container using the `COPY` command.

Next, we expose port 3000 on which our server will run using the `EXPOSE` command.

Finally, we start the server by running the `node server.js` command using the `CMD` command.

This Dockerfile follows best practices for Node.js by using an official Node image, copying the necessary files, installing dependencies, and starting the server.


### ChatGpt 4

To create a Dockerfile for a Node.js application that uses the official Node image, performs the necessary operations to set up your application, and starts the server, follow these steps. The Dockerfile will include instructions to use the Node base image, copy your project files into the image, install dependencies, and define the command to start your Node.js application.

Here is a basic example of such a Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in package.json
RUN npm install

# Make port 3000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 3000

# Define environment variable
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Run the app when the container launches
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

**Explanation**

1. **FROM node:14**:
   - This line tells Docker to use the official Node.js image with the tag `14` from Docker Hub as the base image. You can choose different versions of Node depending on your application's compatibility.

2. **WORKDIR /usr/src/app**:
   - Sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions that follow in the Dockerfile. It's like using `cd` in bash.

3. **COPY . .**:
   - Copies all files from your project’s root to the working directory (`/usr/src/app`) in the Docker container. Ensure your Docker context is set to your project root where your Dockerfile is located.

4. **RUN npm install**:
   - Runs the command inside your image filesystem which installs all dependencies defined in `package.json`.

5. **EXPOSE 3000**:
   - Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network port at runtime. You can change this to whatever port your app runs on.

6. **ENV NODE_ENV=production**:
   - Sets the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production`. This is useful for Node.js applications to run in production mode when applicable.

7. **CMD ["node", "app.js"]**:
   - Provides the command that will be executed when the Docker container starts. Here it's starting your Node.js application. Adjust `"app.js"` to the path of your main file if it's different.

**Building and Running the Docker Container**

- **Build your Docker image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t my-nodejs-app .
  ```
  This command builds the Docker image with the tag `my-nodejs-app` using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

- **Run your Docker container**:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nodejs-app
  ```
  This command runs your Docker container, mapping port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your host, allowing you to access your Node.js app at `localhost:3000`.

Ensure your `package.json` has the right start script if you're using something other than `node app.js` to start your application. Adjust the `CMD` in the Dockerfile accordingly, for example, using `CMD ["npm", "start"]` if you have defined a start script in your `package.json`.

### Meta.ai

Here is a basic Dockerfile for a Node.js application:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js image as the base
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the local files to the container
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Start the server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Here's what each line does:

- `FROM node:14`: Uses the official Node.js 14 image as the base image for our Docker image.
- `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory in the container to /app.
- `COPY . .`: Copies the local files from the current directory (i.e., the directory containing the Dockerfile) to the working directory in the container.
- `RUN npm install`: Runs the npm install command to install the dependencies listed in package.json.
- C`MD ["npm", "start"]`: Sets the default command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs npm start to start the server.
  
To build and run the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

This will build the Docker image and start a container from it, mapping port 3000 on the host machine to port 3000 in the container. You can then access your Node.js application at `http://localhost:3000`.


### Gemini


```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js 16 image (slim variant for smaller size)
FROM node:16-slim

# Set a working directory for the application within the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application code from the current directory to the working directory
COPY . .

# Install dependencies defined in package.json
RUN npm install

# Expose the port where the application listens (replace 3000 with your actual port)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the server using the command defined in your package.json start script (or a custom command)
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Image:**
   - `FROM node:16-slim`: This line specifies the base image we're using. We choose the official Node.js 16 image with the "slim" variant for a smaller image size. You can adjust the version based on your application's requirements.

2. **Working Directory:**
   - `WORKDIR /app`: This line sets the working directory within the container where your application code will be placed.

3. **Copy Application Code:**
   - `COPY . .`: This line copies all files and directories from the current directory on your machine (where the Dockerfile resides) to the working directory (`/app`) within the container.

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   - `RUN npm install`: This line runs the `npm install` command inside the container to install the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.

5. **Expose Port:**
   - `EXPOSE 3000`: This line tells Docker to expose port 3000 (replace with the port your application listens on) from the container. This allows external communication with your application.

6. **Start Server:**
   - `CMD [ "npm", "start" ]`: This line defines the default command to run when the container starts. Here, we use `npm start`, which typically executes the script defined in the `start` field of your `package.json` file (assuming it starts your Node.js server). You can replace this with a custom command if your application has a different startup process.

**Building and Running the Image:**

1. Save this Dockerfile as a file named `Dockerfile` in your project directory.
2. Build the Docker image using the following command (replace `your_image_name` with your desired name):

```bash
docker build -t your_image_name .
```

3. Run the container based on the built image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 your_image_name
```

This command runs the container, maps the container's port 3000 to the host machine's port 3000, and starts your Node.js application. 

## Analysis

### Amazon Q
   - **Pros**: Provides a comprehensive Dockerfile with detailed steps and comments. It uses `npm ci` which is more suitable for production builds due to its clean slate approach.
   - **Cons**: None significant for the context given.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm ci
     COPY . .
     EXPOSE 3000
     CMD ["npm", "start"]
     ```

### GitHub Copilot
   - **Pros**: Similar structure to Amazon Q, ensures that the Node.js application is properly containerized with all necessary steps.
   - **Cons**: It does not include the `npm ci` command which might be preferable in automated builds for consistency.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     EXPOSE 3000
     CMD ["npm", "start"]
     ```

### Axet Gaia
   - **Pros**: Includes clear comments and correct Dockerfile directives for setting up a Node.js application. It changes the command to start the server with `node server.js` which assumes the entry point is `server.js`.
   - **Cons**: Uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci`. This choice may lead to slightly different dependency trees between environments but is commonly used.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:latest
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     EXPOSE 3000
     CMD ["node", "server.js"]
     ```

### ChatGPT 4
   - **Pros**: Provides a very detailed explanation of each step and includes a comprehensive guide on how to build and run the Docker container.
   - **Cons**: Specifies `node app.js` in the CMD directive, which requires users to have `app.js` as their entry point. This could be considered a limitation if the entry point differs.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /usr/src/app
     COPY . .
     RUN npm install
     EXPOSE 3000
     ENV NODE_ENV=production
     CMD ["node", "app.js"]
     ```

### Meta.ai
   - **Pros**: Simplifies the Dockerfile to its essential components without extra configuration, making it easy for beginners to understand.
   - **Cons**: Does not specify a node version, using `node:latest` which might lead to unexpected behavior if the Node.js version changes in the future.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . .
     RUN npm install
     CMD ["npm", "start"]
     ```

### Gemini



- **Pros:** Gemini uses the Node 16 slim image, which optimizes the container size while ensuring up-to-date Node.js features.
- **Cons:** It does not specify copying `package.json` and `package-lock.json` separately before running `npm install`, which can slow down builds due to lack of caching.
- **Code Example**: 
```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js 16 image (slim variant for smaller size)
FROM node:16-slim

# Set a working directory for the application within the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application code from the current directory to the working directory
COPY . .

# Install dependencies defined in package.json
RUN npm install

# Expose the port where the application listens (replace 3000 with your actual port)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the server using the command defined in your package.json start script (or a custom command)
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```



## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: **Amazon Q** remains the best balance of detail and production-ready practices, including the use of `npm ci` for dependency installation which is preferred for consistent builds.

**Worst Implementation**: **Meta.ai** and **Gemini** could potentially lead to issues with future Node.js version changes and inefficient builds due to their approach, making them slightly less preferable.

# 16. Error Handling in NodeJs

## Prompt

Write a NodeJs function to open and read a file. Use try-catch blocks to handle possible exceptions such as 'FileNotFoundException' and 'IOException'.

## Results

### Amazon Q

```js
const fs = require('fs');

function readFile(filePath) {
  try {
    // Attempt to read the file
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    console.log('File content:', data);
  } catch (err) {
    // Handle file-related exceptions
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      console.error('File not found:', filePath);
    } else {
      console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
readFile('/path/to/file.txt');
```

Here's how the `readFile` function works:

1. The function takes a `filePath` parameter, which is the path to the file you want to read.

1. Inside the function, we use a `try-catch` block to handle any exceptions that may occur. 

1. Inside the `try` block, we use the `fs.readFileSync` function to read the contents of the file synchronously. The `'utf8'` encoding is specified to ensure the file content is returned as a string.

1. If the file is read successfully, we log the file content to the console.

1. If an exception occurs, the `catch` block is executed.

1. Inside the `catch` block, we check the `err.code` property to determine the type of exception. If the code is `'ENOENT'`, it means the file was not found, so we log an error message. For any other exceptions, we log a generic error message.

In this example, we're using the synchronous `fs.readFileSync` function to read the file. If you need to read the file asynchronously, you can use the `fs.readFile` function instead, and the error handling would be slightly different:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

function readFile(filePath, callback) {
  fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
        console.error('File not found:', filePath);
      } else {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err);
      }
      callback(err);
    } else {
      console.log('File content:', data);
      callback(null, data);
    }
  });
}

// Example usage
readFile('/path/to/file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File read successfully!');
  }
});
```
In this asynchronous version, the `readFile` function takes a callback function as the second argument, which is called with an error object (if any) and the file data (if the read was successful).


### GitHub Copilot



```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFile(filePath) {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Got an error trying to read the file: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
```

In this function, `fs.readFile` is used to read the file. If the file does not exist or cannot be read for some reason, an error will be thrown and caught in the catch block. The error message will then be logged to the console.

### Axet Gaia


```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function readFile(filePath) {
  try {
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    // Process the file data here
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
      // Handle 'FileNotFoundException' here
      console.error('File not found');
    } else {
      // Handle 'IOException' here
      console.error('Error reading file');
    }
    return null;
  }
}

// Usage example
const filePath = 'path/to/file.txt';
const fileData = readFile(filePath);
if (fileData) {
  console.log('File data:', fileData);
}
```

Explanation of the solution:

1. We start by importing the `fs` module, which provides file system-related functionality in Node.js.
2. The `readFile` function takes a `filePath` parameter and attempts to read the file using `fs.readFileSync`.
3. Inside a try-catch block, we read the file data and return it if successful.
4. If an exception is caught, we check the `error.code` to determine the type of exception.
5. If the code is `'ENOENT'`, it means the file was not found, so we handle the 'FileNotFoundException' case.
6. If the code is anything else, it means there was an error reading the file, so we handle the 'IOException' case.
7. In both error cases, we log an error message and return `null`.
8. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the `readFile` function by providing a file path and logging the file data if it exists.

This solution follows best practices by using synchronous file reading (`fs.readFileSync`) within a try-catch block to handle exceptions.

### ChatGpt 4

In Node.js, handling file operations such as opening and reading files can be efficiently managed using the built-in `fs` (File System) module. Below is an example of how you can write a Node.js function to open and read a file. This function uses asynchronous methods from the `fs` module along with try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, specifically using `fs.promises` for modern async/await syntax.

Here’s how you can implement the function:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises; // Import the promise-based version of the fs module

async function readFile(filePath) {
    try {
        // Read the file asynchronously
        const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors during file read operation
        if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
            console.error('File not found:', filePath);
        } else if (error.code === 'EACCES') {
            console.error('Permission denied to read the file:', filePath);
        } else {
            console.error('An error occurred while reading the file:', error);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage of the readFile function
readFile('path/to/your/file.txt');
```

**Explanation**

- **Importing the `fs` module**: We use `require('fs').promises` to import the promise-based functions of the `fs` module. This allows you to use `async/await` for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
  
- **Function `readFile`**: This asynchronous function accepts `filePath` as a parameter, which is the path to the file you want to read.
  
- **Try-Catch Block**: 
  - **Try Block**: The `fs.readFile` method is used to read the file asynchronously. If the file is read successfully, its contents are logged to the console.
  - **Catch Block**: Catches any errors that occur during the file operation. It checks for different types of errors using the error code:
    - `ENOENT`: Stands for "Error NO ENTry" and indicates that the file does not exist at the specified path.
    - `EACCES`: Indicates that the process lacks the necessary permissions to read the file.
    - Other errors are logged with a general error message.

**Usage:**

- To use this function, replace `'path/to/your/file.txt'` with the actual path to the file you wish to read.
- This function will log the contents of the file if it exists and can be accessed, or an appropriate error message if an issue occurs.

This approach is recommended for handling file I/O in modern Node.js applications due to its use of promises and async/await, which improve error handling and control flow compared to older callback-based approaches.


### Meta.ai

Here is a Node.js function that opens and reads a file, using try-catch blocks to handle possible exceptions:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

function readFile(filePath) {
  try {
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
      throw new Error(`File not found: ${filePath}`);
    } else if (error.code === 'EIO') {
      throw new Error(`IO error reading file: ${filePath}`);
    } else {
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

// Example usage:
const filePath = './example.txt';
try {
  const fileContent = readFile(filePath);
  console.log(fileContent);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

Here's what's happening:

- We require the fs module, which provides file system functionality.
- We define a function readFile that takes a file path as an argument.
- We use fs.readFileSync to read the file contents, specifying the encoding as 'utf8'.
- We catch any errors that occur during file reading using a try-catch block.
- We check the error code to handle specific exceptions:
    - ENOENT (file not found): We throw a custom error with a friendly message.
    - EIO (IO error): We throw a custom error with a friendly message.
    - Other errors: We rethrow the original error.
  
- In the example usage, we call readFile with a file path and log the file contents if successful, or catch and log any errors that occur.

### Gemini

```javascript
const fs = require('fs/promises'); // Using promises for async/await syntax

async function readFile(filePath) {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'ENOENT') { // Handle 'ENOENT' for file not found
      console.error(`Error: File not found: ${filePath}`);
    } else {
      console.error(`Error reading file: ${filePath}`, error);
    }
    throw error; // Re-throw the error for further handling if needed
  }
}

// Example usage
(async () => {
  try {
    const content = await readFile('data.txt');
    console.log(content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  }
})();
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fs/promises`:** We import the `fs/promises` module to use the promise-based versions of file system functions. This allows us to use `async/await` syntax for cleaner handling of asynchronous operations.

2. **`readFile` Function:**
   - Takes a `filePath` argument specifying the path to the file.
   - Uses `try...catch` block for error handling.
   - Inside `try`:
     - Uses `await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8')` to read the file content asynchronously. The `'utf-8'` encoding ensures the data is decoded correctly.
     - If successful, the function returns the read data (`data`).
   - Inside `catch`:
     - Checks the error code using `error.code`.
     - If the code is `'ENOENT'`, it indicates a file not found error. We log a specific message for this case.
     - Otherwise, it logs a generic error message with the error object for debugging.
     - We re-throw the error using `throw error` to allow for further handling if needed in the calling code.

3. **Example Usage:**
   - We wrap the function call in an `async` function to use `await`.
   - Inside the `try` block:
     - We call `readFile('data.txt')` asynchronously and store the result in `content`.
     - If successful, we log the content of the file.
   - Inside the `catch` block:
     - We log a generic error message if any errors occur during file reading.

**Improvements:**

- This example uses a specific error code check for `'ENOENT'`. You can add more checks for other potential `fs` errors (e.g., permissions errors).
- Consider returning a default value or throwing a custom error for the `catch` block if appropriate for your application logic. 


## Analysis

### **Amazon Q**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function readFile(filePath) {
  try {
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    console.log('File content:', data);
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      console.error('File not found:', filePath);
    } else {
      console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
readFile('/path/to/file.txt');
```

- **Pros**: Uses synchronous reading for simplicity. Good use of specific error handling for 'File not found'.
- **Cons**: Synchronous file reading might block Node.js's single-threaded execution if used in a production environment.

### **GitHub Copilot**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Got an error trying to read the file: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
```

- **Pros**: Uses asynchronous reading with promises and async/await, which is more suitable for real-world applications.
- **Cons**: Generic error handling without specific error messages for different types of errors.

### **Axet Gaia**

    if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
      console.error('File not found');
    } else {
      console.error('Error reading file');
    }
    return null;
  }
}

const filePath = 'path/to/file.txt';
const fileData = readFile(filePath);
if (fileData) {
  console.log('File data:', fileData);
}
```

- **Pros**: Clearly distinguishes between 'File not found' and other IO errors.
- **Cons**: Still uses synchronous reading; error messages could include more detail or the file path.

### **ChatGpt 4**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises; // Import the promise-based version of the fs module

async function readFile(filePath) {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
            console.error('File not found:', filePath);
        } else if (error.code === 'EACCES') {
            console.error('Permission denied to read the file:', filePath);
        } else {
            console.error('An error occurred while reading the file:', error);
        }
    }
}

readFile('path/to/your/file.txt');
```

- **Pros**: Asynchronous approach with detailed error handling for different scenarios.
- **Cons**: None significant, represents best practices for modern Node.js applications.

### **Meta.ai**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function readFile(filePath) {
  try {
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    return data;

      throw new Error(`File not found: ${filePath}`);
    } else if (error.code === 'EIO') {
      throw new Error(`IO error reading file: ${filePath}`);
    } else {

    }
  }
}

try {
  const fileContent = readFile('./example.txt');
  console.log(fileContent);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

- **Pros**: Implements error throwing which could be useful in larger applications where error handling is managed at higher levels.
- **Cons**: Uses synchronous file operations; might not be suitable for all use cases.


### Gemini

```javascript
const fs = require('fs/promises'); // Using promises for async/await syntax

async function readFile(filePath) {

  try {
    const content = await readFile('data.txt');
    console.log(content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  }
})();

```

- **Pros**: Gemini’s solution employs modern asynchronous error handling with explicit checks for common file system errors, enhancing readability and functionality.
- **Cons**: The example lacks a comprehensive approach to differentiating between more specific IO errors beyond the file not found scenario, which could be critical in robust applications.

## Conclusion

**Best Implementation**: ChatGpt 4's solution provides an asynchronous approach with comprehensive error handling, which is generally best suited for real-world applications that require non-blocking operations.

**Worst Implementation**: While not necessarily bad, solutions using synchronous methods such as those from Amazon Q and Axet Gaia might not be optimal for performance in production environments due to their blocking nature.

                {emailError}
              </Form.Control.Feedback>
            </Form.Group>

            <Form.Group className="mb-3" controlId="formBasicPassword">
              <Form.Label>Password</Form.Label>
              <Form.Control
                type="password"
                placeholder="Password"
                value={password}
                onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
                isInvalid={!!passwordError}
              />
              <Form.Control.Feedback type="invalid">
                {passwordError}
              </Form.Control.Feedback>
            </Form.Group>

            <Button variant="primary" type="submit">
              Submit
            </Button>
          </Form>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </Container>
  )
}

// tests/index.test.js
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Home from '../pages/index';

test('renders the login form', () => {
  render(<Home />);
  expect(screen.getByLabelText('Email address')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByLabelText('Password')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('validates the login form', () => {
  render(<Home />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }));
  expect(screen.getByText('Email is required')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText('Password is required')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

This example covers the following:

1. **NextJS**: The project is built using the Next.js framework.

1. **Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: The authentication is handled using the `next-auth/providers/microsoft` package, which integrates with the Microsoft OAuth 2.0 provider.

1. **Bootstrap**: The project uses the Bootstrap CSS framework for styling.

1. **Form with Inline Validation**: The login form includes email and password fields with inline validation.

1. **WCAG Compliance**: The project uses standard HTML elements and follows best practices for accessibility.

1. **Jest Tests**: The example includes two basic tests using the `@testing-library/react` library.

To use this example, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

- `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`: Your Microsoft OAuth 2.0 client ID

- `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Microsoft OAuth 2.0 client secret

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used for NextAuth.js

Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to customize it further to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, make sure to follow best practices for handling sensitive information, such as storing environment variables securely.

### GitHub Copilot


```bash
# Step 1: Initialize a new Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-app

# Navigate into the project directory
cd nextjs-app

# Step 2: Install necessary packages for Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authentication
npm install next-auth

# Step 3: Install Bootstrap for CSS framework
npm install bootstrap

# Step 4: Create a form with mandatory username (email) and password fields, both with inline validation
# This step will be done in the code, not in the terminal

# Step 5: Ensure the project is WCAG compliant
# This step will be done in the code, not in the terminal

# Step 6: Install Jest and set up a basic test
npm install --save-dev jest
```

For step 4, you can create a new file in the `pages` directory, say `login.js`, and add the form there. For step 5, you need to follow WCAG guidelines when writing your code. For step 6, you can create a new file in the root directory, say `App.test.js`, and write your tests there.


### Axet Gaia

To implement the technical requirement, you can modify the provided JavaScript code as follows:

```js
// Import necessary modules
import React from 'react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import * as yup from 'yup';
import { yupResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/yup';

// Define the validation schema using yup
const schema = yup.object().shape({
  username: yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Email is required'),
  password: yup.string().required('Password is required'),
});

// Create a functional component for the form
const Form = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit, errors } = useForm({
    resolver: yupResolver(schema),
  });

  // Handle form submission
  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username (Email)</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username" ref={register} />
        {errors.username && <p>{errors.username.message}</p>}
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" ref={register} />
        {errors.password && <p>{errors.password.message}</p>}
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default Form;
```

**Explanation**

- We import the necessary modules, including React, react-hook-form, yup, and @hookform/resolvers/yup.
- We define a validation schema using yup, which specifies that the username field should be a valid email and is required, and the password field is required.
- We create a functional component called Form.
- Inside the Form component, we use the useForm hook from react-hook-form, passing the yupResolver to handle form validation based on the defined schema.
- We define an onSubmit function to handle form submission. In this example, it simply logs the form data to the console.
- The return statement renders a form with input fields for username and password. The ref attribute is used to register the input fields with react-hook-form.
- We display error messages for invalid inputs using the errors object provided by react-hook-form and yup validation.

This implementation follows best practices by using a popular form library (react-hook-form) and a validation library (yup) to handle form validation. It also separates concerns by defining the validation schema separately and using a functional component for the form.

### ChatGpt 4

To set up a Next.js project with Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authentication, Bootstrap as the CSS framework, a form with validation, WCAG compliance, and Jest testing, follow these step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1: Initialize the Next.js Project**

First, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

You’ll need several packages for OAuth, Bootstrap, form validation, and testing:

```bash
npm install next-auth @next-auth/microsoft-provider bootstrap formik yup jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

**Step 3: Set Up Bootstrap**

Import Bootstrap in your project. Add it globally by modifying `_app.js`:

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

**Step 4: Configure Microsoft OAuth 2.0**

Set up NextAuth.js to handle OAuth with Microsoft. Modify `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` to include Microsoft authentication:

```js
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import MicrosoftProvider from "@next-auth/microsoft-provider";

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    MicrosoftProvider({
      clientId: process.env.MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET,
      authorization: { params: { scope: "openid email profile" } }
    }),
  ],
})
```
Ensure you set `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` and `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env.local` file.

**Step 5: Create a Form with Validation**

Use Formik and Yup for client-side validation. Create a form in `pages/index.js`:

```js
import { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from 'formik';
import * as Yup from 'yup';

const validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  username: Yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Required'),
  password: Yup.string().required('Required'),
});

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="container mt-5">
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <Formik
        initialValues={{ username: '', password: '' }}
        validationSchema={validationSchema}
        onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting }) => {
          alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
          setSubmitting(false);
        }}
      >
        <Form>
          <div className="form-group">
            <label htmlFor="username">Email:</label>
            <Field name="username" type="email" className="form-control" />
            <ErrorMessage name="username" component="div" className="text-danger" />
          </div>
          <div className="form-group">
            <label htmlFor="password">Password:</label>
            <Field name="password" type="password" className="form-control" />
            <ErrorMessage name="password" component="div" className="text-danger" />
          </div>
          <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary">
            Submit
          </button>
        </Form>
      </Formik>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Step 6: Ensure WCAG Compliance**

For accessibility:

- Ensure all form elements have appropriate labels.
- Use semantic HTML.
- Check color contrasts and provide ARIA roles where necessary.

You can utilize tools like aXe or Wave to check compliance automatically.

**Step 7: Write Jest Tests**

Set up Jest to test your Next.js application. First, configure Jest by creating a `jest.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  testPathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/.next/', '<rootDir>/node_modules/'],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
  },
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
};
```

Create `jest.setup.js` for extending Jest with additional functionality:
```js
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

Then, create a test file `__tests__/index.test.js` for the form:

```js
import { render, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import Home from '../pages/index';

describe('Home', () => {
  it('renders the form and submits data', async () => {
    const { getByLabelText, getByRole, findByText } = render(<Home />);

    fireEvent.change(getByLabelText(/email/i), { target: { value: 'user@example.com' } });
    fireEvent.change(getByLabelText(/password/i), { target: { value: 'password' } });

    fireEvent.click(getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }));

    await findByText(/user@example.com/);
  });
});
```

To run your tests, add a script to your `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Then execute the tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

This setup provides a full-stack solution using Next.js with Microsoft OAuth 2.0, Bootstrap, Formik for forms with inline validation, Jest for testing, and ensures WCAG compliance.

### Meta.ai


Here is a basic setup for a Next.js project that meets the characteristics you specified:

**Project Structure**
```
components
LoginForm.js
...
pages
index.js
...
public
...
styles
bootstrap.min.css
...
tests
LoginForm.test.js
...
next.config.js
package.json
```

**next.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [
    [
      'next-auth',
      {
        // Configure Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authentication
        auth: {
          microsoft: {
            clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
            clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
            tenantId: 'YOUR_TENANT_ID',
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

**components/LoginForm.js**

```jsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { useState } from 'react';

function LoginForm() {
  const { register, handleSubmit, errors } = useForm();
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    // Call NextAuth's signIn function
    const result = await signIn('microsoft', data);
    if (result.ok) {
      // Login successful, redirect to protected page
    } else {
      // Login failed, show error message
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <div>
        <label>Username (email)</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          {...register('username', { required: true })}
          value={username}
          onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
        />
        {errors.username && <span>Required</span>}
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>Password</label>
        <input
          type="password"
          {...register('password', { required: true })}
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
        {errors.password && <span>Required</span>}
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default LoginForm;
```

**pages/index.js**
```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';
import LoginForm from '../components/LoginForm';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Login Page</title>
      </Head>
      <LoginForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

**styles/bootstrap.min.css**
```css
/* Bootstrap CSS framework */
```

**tests/LoginForm.test.js**
```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import LoginForm from '../components/LoginForm';

describe('LoginForm', () => {
  it('renders form with username and password fields', () => {
    const { getByLabelText } = render(<LoginForm />);
    expect(getByLabelText('Username (email)')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(getByLabelText('Password')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('validates username and password fields', async () => {
    const { getByLabelText, getByText } = render(<LoginForm />);
    const usernameInput = getByLabelText('Username (email)');
    const passwordInput = getByLabelText('Password');
    const submitButton = getByText('Login');

    // Test invalid submission
    fireEvent.change(usernameInput, { target: { value: '' } });
    fireEvent.change(passwordInput, { target: { value: '' } });
    fireEvent.click(submitButton);
    await waitFor(() => getByText('Required'));
    expect(getByText('Required')).toBeInTheDocument();

    // Test valid submission
    fireEvent.change(usernameInput, { target: { value: 'user@example.com' } });
    fireEvent.change(passwordInput, { target: { value: 'password' } });
    fireEvent.click(submitButton);
    await waitFor(() => expect(submitButton).toBeDisabled());
  });
});
```
This setup uses NextAuth for Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authentication, Bootstrap as the CSS framework, and Jest for testing. The `LoginForm` component uses React Hook Form for inline validation. The project structure follows WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

Note that you'll need to replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_TENANT_ID` with your actual Microsoft Azure AD application credentials.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

### Gemini


**1. Project Setup:**

- Create a new Next.js project:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app my-app
   ```

- Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install bootstrap @types/bootstrap react-hook-form yup react-test-renderer msgraph-sdk-javascript
   ```

**2. Microsoft Azure AD Authentication (OAuth 2.0):**

**Explanation:**

- Create an Azure AD application in the Azure portal ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app)).
- Configure the following settings in your Azure AD application:
   - **Supported account types:** Choose who can access your application (e.g., accounts in any organizational directory).
   - **Redirect URIs (web):** Add the redirect URI for your Next.js application. This follows the format `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`.
   - **Expose an API (optional):** If your application needs to access Microsoft Graph data, enable the appropriate Microsoft Graph delegated permissions (e.g., User.Read).
- Obtain the following application details from Azure AD:
   - Client ID
   - Authority (usually in the format `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0`)

**3. Environment Variables:**

- Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project (**gitignore** this file):

   ```
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   AZURE_AD_AUTHORITY=your_authority_uri
   # ... other environment variables you might need (e.g., Microsoft Graph scopes)
   ```

- Load environment variables in `next.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     reactStrictMode: true,
     env: {
       AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID: process.env.AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID,
       AZURE_AD_AUTHORITY: process.env.AZURE_AD_AUTHORITY,
       // ... other environment variables
     },
   };
   ```

**4. Authentication Provider (Context API):**

   - Create a file named `AuthContext.js`:

     ```javascript
     import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
     import { msGraphClient } from '../utils/msGraphClient'; // Import helper function

     const AuthContext = createContext({
       user: null,
       setUser: () => {},
       isAuthenticated: false,
       setIsAuthenticated: () => {},
       isLoading: true,
       setIsLoading: () => {},
     });

     export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
       const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
       const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

       useEffect(() => {
         // Check for existing authentication in local storage
         const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('user');
         if (storedUser) {
           setUser(JSON.parse(storedUser));
           setIsAuthenticated(true);
         }
         setIsLoading(false);
       }, []);

       const handleLogin = async (data) => {
         // Implement login logic using MSAL library (refer to official documentation)
         // ...
       };

       const handleLogout = () => {
         setUser(null);
         setIsAuthenticated(false);
         localStorage.removeItem('user');
         // Optionally, redirect to Azure AD logout endpoint
       };

       const contextValue = {
         user,
         setUser,
         isAuthenticated,
         setIsAuthenticated,
         isLoading,
         setIsLoading,
         handleLogin,
         handleLogout,
       };

       return (
         <AuthContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>
       );
     };

     export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);

     export default AuthContext;
     ```

**5. Login Form Component (`LoginForm.js`):**

   - Create a component for the login form using `react-hook-form` for validation and Bootstrap classes for styling:

     ```javascript
     import React from 'react';
     import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
     import { yupResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/yup';
     import * as yup from 'yup';
     import { useAuth } from './AuthContext'; // Import AuthContext
     ```

    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      ...
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Gemini

**Pros:**
Gemini provides a structured approach to project setup with clear steps, focusing on using modern tools and libraries like `react-hook-form`, `yup`, and Microsoft Graph SDK. It offers a concise and clean implementation for setting up Microsoft Azure AD authentication and Bootstrap integration.

**Cons:**
The solution lacks specific details on some aspects such as WCAG compliance and Jest testing. Additionally, the example might require further customization to meet specific project requirements, particularly in the context of testing and accessibility.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { yupResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/yup';
import * as yup from 'yup';
import { useAuth } from './AuthContext'; // Import AuthContext

// Define the validation schema using yup
const schema = yup.object().shape({
  username: yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Email is required'),
  password: yup.string().required('Password is required'),
});

// Create a functional component for the form
const LoginForm = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit, errors } = useForm({
    resolver: yupResolver(schema),
  });
  const { handleLogin } = useAuth();

  // Handle form submission
  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    await handleLogin(data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username (Email)</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username" ref={register} />
        {errors.username && <p>{errors.username.message}</p>}
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" ref={register} />
        {errors.password && <p>{errors.password.message}</p>}
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default LoginForm;
```


## Conclusion

**Best Implementation:** **Amazon Q**'s solution, despite the authentication error, provides a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of the prompt in detail. It demonstrates practical session management, form processing, and basic testing, aligning well with real-world application requirements.

**Worst Implementation:** **GitHub Copilot**'s submission lacks critical implementation details essential for meeting the project's requirements. This makes it less practical for developers needing a more guided and detailed approach to setting up all aspects of a Next.js project.

1. the example is the same of the previous example, only translated in Italian
2. I tried also Chinese prompt and the results are consistent with the Italian test
3. for point 2 I deliberately used the wrong name (Microsoft Azure authentication exists, not just Microsoft)

## Results

### Amazon Q

I apologize, but your request seems to be outside my domain of expertise. However, I'm happy to try discussing related topics that I may have more information on. How can I help further our conversation productively?

### GitHub Copilot


```bash
# 1. Crea un nuovo progetto Next.js
npx create-next-app@latest

# 2. Installa le dipendenze per l'autenticazione Microsoft OAuth 2.0
npm install next-auth
npm install @types/next-auth --save-dev

# 3. Installa e configura Bootstrap
npm install bootstrap
# Aggiungi import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' nel file _app.js

# 4. Crea un modulo di accesso con validazione
# Questo sarà fatto nel codice JavaScript/TypeScript, non è un comando da terminale

# 5. Assicurati che il tuo sito sia conforme alle WCAG
# Questo richiede una revisione del codice e del design, non è un comando da terminale

# 6. Configura Jest per i test
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Per l'autenticazione Microsoft OAuth 2.0, dovrai creare un file `[...nextauth].js` nella directory `pages/api/auth` del tuo progetto. All'interno di questo file, dovrai configurare NextAuth per utilizzare Microsoft come provider.

Per il modulo di accesso con validazione, dovrai creare un componente React con due campi di input (per l'e-mail e la password) e utilizzare lo stato e gli eventi di React per gestire e validare l'input dell'utente.

Per la conformità WCAG, dovrai seguire le linee guida WCAG durante lo sviluppo del tuo sito. Potrebbe essere utile utilizzare strumenti come l'estensione Accessibility Insights for Web di Chrome per aiutarti a identificare eventuali problemi di accessibilità.

Infine, per configurare Jest, dovrai creare un file di configurazione Jest (ad esempio, `jest.config.js`) nel tuo progetto e scrivere test per il tuo codice.

```javascript
// Import required modules
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';

// Define the component
const LoginForm = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const router = useRouter();

  // Handle form submission
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Perform authentication logic using Microsoft OAuth 2.0
    // ...

    // Redirect to the desired page after successful authentication
    router.push('/dashboard');
  };

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <Form.Group controlId="formUsername">
        <Form.Label>Email</Form.Label>
        <Form.Control
          type="email"
          placeholder="Enter email"
          value={username}
          onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
        <Form.Control.Feedback type="invalid">
          Please enter a valid email.
        </Form.Control.Feedback>
      </Form.Group>

      <Form.Group controlId="formPassword">
        <Form.Label>Password</Form.Label>
        <Form.Control
          type="password"
          placeholder="Password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
        <Form.Control.Feedback type="invalid">
          Please enter a password.
        </Form.Control.Feedback>
      </Form.Group>

      <Button variant="primary" type="submit">
        Submit
      </Button>
    </Form>
  );
};

export default LoginForm;
```

This code sets up a login form component using Next.js and React. It includes form fields for email and password, with inline validation using the `required` attribute. The form submission is handled by the `handleSubmit` function, where you can perform the authentication logic using Microsoft OAuth 2.0. After successful authentication, the user is redirected to the `/dashboard` page.

To ensure WCAG compliance, you can add appropriate accessibility attributes to the form elements and ensure proper contrast and keyboard navigation. Additionally, you can write Jest tests to cover the functionality of this component.

Please note that this code is just a starting point and may require additional configuration and implementation depending on your specific project setup and requirements.

### ChatGpt 4

Per iniziare un progetto con le caratteristiche che hai descritto, posso guidarti passo dopo passo per configurare un ambiente di sviluppo utilizzando Next.js, Microsoft OAuth 2.0 per l'autenticazione, Bootstrap per il CSS, un modulo di accesso con validazione, conformità alle WCAG e test con Jest. Ecco una panoramica dettagliata su come procedere:

**1. Impostare l'ambiente di sviluppo Next.js**

Prima di tutto, assicurati di avere Node.js installato. Poi crea un nuovo progetto Next.js:

```bash
npx create-next-app nome-progetto
cd nome-progetto
```

**2. Installare Bootstrap**

Installa Bootstrap per gestire il CSS:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

Dopo l'installazione, importa Bootstrap nel tuo file `_app.js` per usarlo globalmente:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

**3. Configurare l'autenticazione Microsoft OAuth 2.0**

Per integrare l'autenticazione Microsoft, puoi usare `next-auth`. Installa `next-auth` e una libreria per i client OAuth:

```bash
npm install next-auth @next-auth/microsoft-provider
```

Configura `next-auth` creando un file ` [...nextauth].js` dentro la cartella `pages/api/auth` e configuralo con le tue credenziali OAuth di Microsoft:

```javascript
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import MicrosoftProvider from "next-auth/providers/microsoft"

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    MicrosoftProvider({
      clientId: process.env.MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET
    })
  ],
})
```

**4. Creare un modulo di accesso**

Crea un modulo in una nuova pagina, per esempio `pages/login.js`. Assicurati che il modulo abbia la validazione in linea e sia conforme alle WCAG:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react';

function LoginPage() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({ username: '', password: '' });

  const validateForm = () => {
    let valid = true;
    if (!username.includes('@')) {
      setErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, username: 'Inserisci un'email valida.' }));
      valid = false;
    }
    if (password.length < 8) {
      setErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, password: 'La password deve essere di almeno 8 caratteri.' }));
      valid = false;
    }
    return valid;
  };

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    if (validateForm()) {
      // Implementa la logica di autenticazione qui
      signIn('microsoft', { username, password });
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="container mt-5">
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <div className="form-group">
          <label>Email</label>
          <input type="email" className="form-control" value={username} onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
          {errors.username && <div className="alert alert-danger">{errors.username}</div>}
        </div>
        <div className="form-group">
          <label>Password</label>
          <input type="password" className="form-control" value={password} onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)} />
          {errors.password && <div className="alert alert-danger">{errors.password}</div>}
        </div>
        <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary">Login</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default LoginPage;
```

**5. Aggiungere Jest per i test**

Installazione di Jest e delle sue dipendenze per il testing:

```bash
npm install jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom babel-jest
```

Configura Jest aggiungendo la seguente configurazione nel tuo `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"],
  "testPathIgnorePatterns": ["<rootDir>/.next/", "<rootDir>/node_modules/"],
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$": "identity-obj-proxy"
  }
}
```

Crea un file `jest.setup.js` nella radice del tuo progetto per configurare il testing library:

```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

Puoi ora scrivere i test dentro una cartella `__tests__` nella radice del tuo progetto.

                value: 'Bearer ' + (await auth.login()),
              },
            ],
          },

    if (!isValid) {
      return;
    }

    // Invia i dati di login al server qui

    console.log('Invio dati di login:', { email, password });
  };

  const validateForm = () => {
    const newErrors = {};

    if (!email) {
      newErrors.email = 'Inserire un indirizzo e-mail';
    }

    if (!password) {
      newErrors.password = 'Inserire una password';
    }

    setErrors(newErrors);
    return !Object.keys(newErrors).length;
  };

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <FormGroup controlId="formEmail">
        <Label>Indirizzo e-mail</Label>
        <Input type="email" value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} isInvalid={errors.email} />

# Adopting Generative AI for Writing Technical Documentation

Technical documentation is a critical component of any software or technical product. It ensures that users and developers understand how to use, maintain, and troubleshoot a product. However, creating and maintaining high-quality technical documentation can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This is where generative AI (GenAI) comes into play. By leveraging the capabilities of GenAI, organizations can streamline the documentation process, improve accuracy, and maintain consistency across documents.

## Benefits of Using GenAI for Technical Documentation

### Efficiency and Speed

GenAI can significantly reduce the time required to produce technical documentation. By automating repetitive tasks such as formatting, generating boilerplate text, and updating content, writers can focus on more complex and value-added tasks. This leads to faster delivery of documentation and more efficient use of resources.

### Consistency and Accuracy

Human writers can introduce inconsistencies and errors, especially when multiple individuals work on the same project. GenAI can help maintain a consistent tone, style, and structure throughout the documentation. Additionally, AI models trained on extensive datasets can ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date.

### Improved Accessibility

GenAI can aid in creating documentation that is more accessible to a diverse audience. By using AI-powered tools, writers can easily translate documents into multiple languages, adhere to accessibility standards, and ensure that content is understandable for non-technical users.

### Scalability

As products and services grow, so does the need for comprehensive documentation. GenAI enables organizations to scale their documentation efforts without a proportional increase in resources. This scalability is particularly valuable for startups and growing companies with limited documentation teams.

### Focus on High-Value Content

By letting GenAI handle routine and repetitive tasks, authors can focus on the topics they are more passionate about. This can lead to more engaging and insightful content, as writers dedicate their time and energy to areas that require their expertise and creativity.

## How to Implement GenAI in Technical Documentation

### Selecting the Right Tools

There are various AI-powered tools available for writing technical documentation. Tools like OpenAI's GPT-3, Microsoft's Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), and other specialized AI writing assistants can be integrated into the documentation workflow. Selecting the right tool depends on factors such as the complexity of the documentation, integration capabilities, and budget.

### Training and Customizing AI Models

To achieve the best results, it's essential to train and customize AI models according to the specific requirements of the organization. This involves feeding the AI with existing documentation, user guides, and other relevant content. Customization ensures that the generated documentation aligns with the organization's standards and style.

### Integrating AI with Existing Workflows

Integrating AI tools into existing documentation workflows is crucial for seamless adoption. This may involve using plugins or APIs to connect AI tools with content management systems (CMS), version control systems, and collaboration platforms. Ensuring that AI-generated content can be easily reviewed and edited by human writers is also essential.

# model-io

# Model I/O

![Model I/O](../img/model_io-1.jpeg)

There are two main types of models that LangChain integrates with: LLMs and Chat Models. These are defined by their input and output types.


## Prompts (format)

A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to guide the model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences, or engaging in a conversation.

- **Definition**: A class used to manage and structure prompts, ensuring consistency and reusability.
- **Purpose**: Helps in creating standardized prompts that can be reused across different parts of an application.
- **Components**:

    - **Template**: The core structure of the prompt, often including placeholders for dynamic data.
    - **Inputs**: The variables or data points that will be filled into the placeholders in the template.
  
- **Examples**: 


  ```python hl_lines="5 6 7 8"
  # Python Example
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

  # Define a prompt template
  prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
      template="You are an expert assistant. Answer the following question in detail:\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:",
      input_variables=["question"],
  )

  ```

  ```js hl_lines="5 6 7 8"
  // JavaScript Example
  import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts"

  // Define a prompt template
  const promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate({
    template: "You are an expert assistant. Answer the following question in detail:\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:",
    inputVariables: ["question"],
  })
 
  ```

## Chat models (predict)

A chat model is a language model that uses chat messages as inputs and returns chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text).

LangChain has integrations with many model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.) and exposes a standard interface to interact with all of these models.

LangChain allows you to use models in sync, async, batching and streaming modes and provides other features (e.g., caching) and more.

**Definition**:

- Chat models are specialized language models designed to generate conversational responses, simulating human-like dialogue.

**Purpose**:

- The purpose of chat models is to engage in interactive communication, providing responses that are contextually relevant and coherent within a conversational flow.

**Components**:

1. **Dialogue History**: The sequence of previous exchanges between the user and the model.
2. **Context Management**: Mechanisms to maintain and reference context throughout the conversation.
3. **Response Generation**: Algorithms and methods used to produce the model's replies.
4. **User Input**: The input or query provided by the user in the conversation.

**Types**:

1. **Open-domain Chat Models**: Capable of discussing a wide range of topics without a specific focus.
2. **Task-oriented Chat Models**: Designed to accomplish specific tasks, such as booking a ticket or answering customer service queries.

- **Examples**: 


  ```python hl_lines="5"
  # Python Example
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

  # Define a chat model
  chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)

  ```

  ```js hl_lines="5 6 7"
  // JavaScript Example
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

  // Define a chat model
  const chatModel = new ChatOpenAI({
    apiKey: yourOpenAiApiKey,
  });
 
  ```

## LLMs (predict)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain. LangChain does not serve its own LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface for interacting with many different LLMs. To be specific, this interface is one that takes as input a string and returns a string.

There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - the LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.

**Definition**:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensive machine learning models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

**Purpose**:

- The purpose of LLMs is to leverage their understanding of language to perform various tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and answering questions.

**Components**:

1. **Training Data**: The large corpus of text data used to train the model.
2. **Architecture**: The underlying structure of the model, such as transformer networks.
3. **Parameters**: The variables within the model that are learned during training.
4. **Inference Mechanism**: The process by which the model generates output based on input data.

**Types**:

1. **General-purpose LLMs**: Models like GPT-3 that can be adapted for a wide range of tasks.
2. **Domain-specific LLMs**: Models fine-tuned on specific domains like medical or legal text for specialized applications.
3. **Bilingual/Multilingual LLMs**: Models trained to understand and generate text in multiple languages.

- **Examples**: 

  ```python hl_lines="5"
  # Python Example
  from langchain_openai import OpenAI

  # Define a chat model
  llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)

  ```

  ```js hl_lines="5 6 7"
  // JavaScript Example
  import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

  // Define a chat model
  const llm = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: yourOpenAiApiKey,
  });
 
  ```


## Output Parsers (parse)

Output parsers are responsible for taking the output of an LLM and transforming it to a more suitable format. This is very useful when you are asking the LLM to generate any form of structured data.

Besides having a large collection of different types of output parsers, one distinguishing benefit of LangChain OutputParsers is that many of them support streaming.

Certainly! Here is the detailed breakdown for **Output Parsers** in LangChain, including their Definition, Purpose, Components, and Types:



**Definition**:

- Output parsers are tools that take the raw output generated by a language model (LLM) and transform it into a more structured and suitable format.

**Purpose**:

- The purpose of output parsers is to ensure that the output from an LLM can be easily consumed and utilized by other components or systems, especially when the output needs to be in a specific structured format.

**Components**:

1. **Parsing Logic**: The core logic that interprets and transforms the raw output into the desired format.
2. **Streaming Support**: The ability to process output incrementally as it is generated by the LLM, which is beneficial for handling large outputs or real-time data.
3. **Format Specification**: Definitions of the target format, such as JSON, XML, or custom data structures.
4. **Error Handling**: Mechanisms to handle and report errors during the parsing process.

**Types**:

1. **JSON Parsers**: Transform the output into JSON format, useful for APIs and data interchange.
2. **CSV Parsers**: Convert the output into CSV format, suitable for data analysis and spreadsheets.
3. **Custom Parsers**: Designed to transform the output into user-defined structures or formats.
4. **Streaming Parsers**: Handle the output in chunks as it is being generated, allowing for real-time processing and lower memory usage.


**Examples**: 


  ```python hl_lines="9 14 16"
  # Python Example

  from langchain.output_parsers import CommaSeparatedListOutputParser
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
  from langchain_openai import OpenAI

  llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)

  output_parser = CommaSeparatedListOutputParser()

  prompt = PromptTemplate(
      template="List 3 {things}.\n{format_instructions}",
      input_variables=["things"],
      partial_variables={"format_instructions": output_parser.get_format_instructions()})

  chain = prompt | llm | output_parser # RunnableSequence

  result = chain.invoke({"things": "sports that don't use balls"})

  print(result)
  ```

  ```js hl_lines="10 16 20"
  // JavaScript Example

  import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
  import { CommaSeparatedListOutputParser } from "langchain/output_parsers";
  import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts"
  import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

  const llm = new OpenAI({ openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKy });

  const outputParser = new CommaSeparatedListOutputParser();

  const prompt = new PromptTemplate({
      template: "List 3 {things}",
      inputVariables: ["things"],
      partialVariables: {
          formatInstructions: outputParser.getFormatInstructions(),
      },
  });

  const chain = RunnableSequence.from([prompt, llm, outputParser]);

  const result = await chain.invoke({ things: "sports that don't use balls" });

  console.log(result);
  ```

 **Input**: 

  ```
  sports that don't use balls
  ```

 **Output**: 

  ```
  [ '1. Swimming\n2. Skateboarding\n3. Gymnastics' ]
  ```

# retrieval

# Retrieval

![Retrieval](../img/data_connection-1.jpeg)

Many LLM applications require user-specific data that is not part of the model's training set. The primary way of accomplishing this is through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this process, external data is retrieved and then passed to the LLM when doing the generation step.

LangChain provides all the building blocks for RAG applications - from simple to complex. This section of the documentation covers everything related to the retrieval step - e.g. the fetching of the data. Although this sounds simple, it can be subtly complex. This encompasses several key modules.



## Document loaders (load)
Load data from a source as `Documents` for later processing

Use document loaders to load data from a source as Document's. A `Document` is a piece of text and associated metadata. For example, there are document loaders for loading a simple `.txt` file, for loading the text contents of any web page, or even for loading a transcript of a YouTube video.

Document loaders provide a "load" method for loading data as documents from a configured source. They optionally implement a "lazy load" as well for lazily loading data into memory.

**Definition**:

- Document loaders are tools used to load data from various sources into `Document` objects, which contain both text and associated metadata.

**Purpose**:

- The purpose of document loaders is to facilitate the extraction of text and metadata from different sources (e.g., files, web pages, YouTube transcripts) and structure them in a consistent format for further processing.

**Components**:

1. **Source**: The origin of the data (e.g., `.txt` files, web pages).
2. **Load Method**: A method to load data from the source into `Document` objects.
3. **Lazy Load Method**: An optional method for loading data into memory on demand.

**Types**:

1. **Text File Loaders**: Loaders for reading text from files.
2. **Web Page Loaders**: Loaders for extracting text from web pages.
3. **Transcript Loaders**: Loaders for fetching and parsing video transcripts.

```python hl_lines="5 6"
# Python example

from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader("./index.md")
docs = loader.load()

```

```js hl_lines="5 6"
// JavaScript Example

import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";

const loader = new TextLoader("./index.md");
const docs = await loader.load()

```


## Text splitters (transform)
Transform source documents to better suit your application

Once you've loaded documents, you'll often want to transform them to better suit your application. The simplest example is you may want to split a long document into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain has a number of built-in document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, filter, and otherwise manipulate documents.

When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks. As simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What "semantically related" means could depend on the type of text. This notebook showcases several ways to do that.

At a high level, text splitters work as following:

1. Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).
1. Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).
1. Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).
That means there are two different axes along which you can customize your text splitter:

1. How the text is split
1. How the chunk size is measured

**Definition**:

- Text splitters are tools that divide a large piece of text into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks.

**Purpose**:

- The purpose of text splitters is to ensure that the text can fit into a model's context window and to maintain the semantic integrity of the text chunks.

**Components**:

1. **Separator**: The character or pattern used to split the text.
2. **Chunk Size**: The maximum size of each chunk.
3. **Chunk Overlap**: The overlap between chunks to maintain context.
4. **Length Function**: A function to measure the size of each chunk.

**Types**:

1. **Character Text Splitters**: Split text based on character count.
2. **Sentence Text Splitters**: Split text based on sentence boundaries.
3. **Paragraph Text Splitters**: Split text based on paragraph breaks.

```python hl_lines="9 12"

# Python example
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

# Initialize the document loader
loader = TextLoader("./index.md")

# Initialize the text splitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(separator="\n", chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=0)

# Load the documents and split them into chunks
docs = loader.load_and_split(text_splitter=text_splitter)

```


```js hl_lines="7 10 11 12 13 14 17"
// Javascript example

import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";
import { CharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

// Initialize the document loader
const loader = new TextLoader("index.md");

// Initialize the text splitter
const textSplitter = new CharacterTextSplitter({
  separator: "\n",
  chunk_size: 200,
  chunk_overlap: 0,
});

// Load the documents and split them into chunks
const docs = await loader.loadAndSplit(textSplitter)

```

## Embedding models (embed)
Create vector representations of a piece of text, allowing for natural language search


The Embeddings class is a class designed for interfacing with text embedding models. There are lots of embedding model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.

Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.

The base Embeddings class in LangChain provides two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself).

- **Definition**: Dense vector representations of data that capture semantic meanings in a high-dimensional space.
- **Purpose**: Facilitate tasks like semantic search, clustering, and similarity detection by representing text or other data in a numerical format that preserves semantic relationships.

- **Types**:
    - **Word Embeddings**: Represent individual words.
    - **Sentence Embeddings**: Represent entire sentences or paragraphs.
    - **Document Embeddings**: Represent larger blocks of text, like documents or articles.

- **Applications**:

    - **Semantic Search**: Finding semantically similar documents or snippets.
    - **Clustering**: Grouping similar items together.
    - **Similarity Detection**: Measuring how similar two pieces of data are.

- **Examples**:

```python
# Python example

from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(api_key=your_openai_api_key)

embeddings = embeddings_model.embed_documents(
    [
        "Hi there!",
        "Oh, hello!",
        "What's your name?",
        "My friends call me World",
        "Hello World!"
    ]
)
```
```js
// Javascript example

import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const embeddingsModel = new OpenAIEmbeddings({ openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKy });

const embedding = await embeddingsModel.embedDocuments([
    "Hi there!",
    "Oh, hello!",
    "What's your name?",
    "My friends call me World",
    "Hello World!"
])

```

## Vectorstores (store)
Interfaces for specialized databases that can search over unstructured data with natural language

One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are 'most similar' to the embedded query. A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you.

- **Definition**: Databases or storage systems specifically designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors (embeddings).
- **Purpose**: Enable efficient storage, indexing, and querying of vector data, facilitating tasks like nearest neighbor search and clustering.
- **Components**:

    - **Indexing**: Methods to efficiently index vector data for fast retrieval.
    - **Querying**: Mechanisms to query the stored vectors and retrieve the most relevant results.

- **Applications**:

    - **Semantic Search**: Quickly finding the most relevant documents or data points based on semantic similarity.
    - **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting items that are similar to a given query.

- **Examples**:


```python hl_lines="21"
# Python example

from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma

# Initialize the document loader
loader = TextLoader("./index.md")

# Initialize the text splitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(separator="\n", chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=0)

# Load the documents and split them into chunks
docs = loader.load_and_split(text_splitter=text_splitter)

# Initialize the OpenAI embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create the Chroma vector store
db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embedding=embeddings, persist_directory="emb")

# Execute similarity search
result = db.similarity_search("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson")

print(result[0].page_content)


```


```js hl_lines="25 26 27"
// Javascript example

import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";
import { CharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { Chroma } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/chroma";

// Initialize the document loader
const loader = new TextLoader("index.md");

// Initialize the text splitter
const textSplitter = new CharacterTextSplitter({
    separator: "\n",
    chunk_size: 200,
    chunk_overlap: 0,
});

// Load the documents and split them into chunks
const docs = await loader.loadAndSplit(textSplitter)

// Initialize the OpenAI embeddings
const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({ openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKy })

// Create the Chroma vector store
const db = await Chroma.fromDocuments(docs, embeddings, {
    collectionName: "emb",
});

// Execute similarity search
const result = await db.similaritySearch("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson")

console.log(result[0].pageContent)

```

## Retrievers (retrieve)
More generic interfaces that return documents given an unstructured query

A retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. Vector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.

Retrievers accept a string `query` as input and return a list of `Document`'s as output.

**Definition**:

- Retrievers are interfaces that return documents given an unstructured query. They do not necessarily store documents but focus on retrieving relevant documents based on the query.

**Purpose**:

- The purpose of retrievers is to fetch documents that are most relevant to a user's query, enabling efficient information retrieval from a large corpus.

**Components**:

1. **Query Processing**: The mechanism to interpret and process the input query.
2. **Document Retrieval**: The method to retrieve documents that match the query criteria.
3. **Integration with Models**: Ability to work with language models to refine search results.

**Types**:

1. **Vector Store Retrievers**: Use vector embeddings to find semantically similar documents.
2. **Keyword-Based Retrievers**: Use keyword matching to find relevant documents.
3. **Hybrid Retrievers**: Combine multiple methods to improve retrieval accuracy.

```python hl_lines="24 25 26 29"
# Python example

from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma

# Initialize the document loader
loader = TextLoader("./facts.txt")

# Initialize the text splitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(separator="\n", chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=0)

# Load the documents and split them into chunks
docs = loader.load_and_split(text_splitter=text_splitter)

# Initialize the OpenAI embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create the Chroma vector store
db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embedding=embeddings, persist_directory="emb")

# Initialize the retriever
retriever = db.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity_score_threshold", search_kwargs={"score_threshold": 0.5}
)

# Invoke the retriever
result = retriever.invoke("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson")

print(result[0].page_content)
```

```js hl_lines="31 32 33 34 38"
// Javascript example

import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";
import { CharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { Chroma } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/chroma";

// Initialize the document loader
const loader = new TextLoader("./facts.txt");

// Initialize the text splitter
const textSplitter = new CharacterTextSplitter({
    separator: "\n",
    chunk_size: 200,
    chunk_overlap: 0,
});

// Load the documents and split them into chunks
const docs = await loader.loadAndSplit(textSplitter)

// Initialize the OpenAI embeddings
const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({ openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKy })

// Create the Chroma vector store
const db = await Chroma.fromDocuments(docs, embeddings, {
    collectionName: "emb",
});


// Initialize the retriever
const retriever = db.asRetriever({
    searchType: "similarity_score_threshold",
    searchKwargs: { scoreThreshold: 0.5 },
})


// Invoke the retriever
const result = await retriever.invoke("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson")

console.log(result[0].pageContent)

```

## Indexing (organize)

Here, we will look at a basic indexing workflow using the LangChain indexing API.

The indexing API lets you load and keep in sync documents from any source into a vector store. Specifically, it helps:

Avoid writing duplicated content into the vector store
Avoid re-writing unchanged content
Avoid re-computing embeddings over unchanged content
All of which should save you time and money, as well as improve your vector search results.

Crucially, the indexing API will work even with documents that have gone through several transformation steps (e.g., via text chunking) with respect to the original source documents.

- **Definition**: Structures that enable efficient retrieval of information relevant to user queries.
- **Types**:

    - **Document Indexes**: Organize and search large collections of text or data.
    - **Embedding-based Indexes**: Use vector representations of text for semantic search and retrieval.

- **Components**:

    - **Indexing**: The process of creating indexes from data.
    - **Searching**: Retrieving relevant information from indexes based on queries.

- **Examples**:

// Load the documents and split them into chunks
const docs = await loader.loadAndSplit(textSplitter)

// Initialize the OpenAI embeddings
const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({ openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKy })


// Create the Chroma vector store
const db = await Chroma.fromDocuments(docs, embeddings, {

# Composition

![Composition](../img/composition-1.jpeg)

Higher-level components that combine other arbitrary systems and/or or LangChain primitives together

## Tools
Interfaces that allow an LLM to interact with external systems

Tools are interfaces that an agent, chain, or LLM can use to interact with the world. They combine a few things:

1. The name of the tool
1. A description of what the tool is
1. JSON schema of what the inputs to the tool are
1. The function to call
1. Whether the result of a tool should be returned directly to the user

It is useful to have all this information because this information can be used to build action-taking systems! The name, description, and JSON schema can be used to prompt the LLM so it knows how to specify what action to take, and then the function to call is equivalent to taking that action.

The simpler the input to a tool is, the easier it is for an LLM to be able to use it. Many agents will only work with tools that have a single string input. For a list of agent types and which ones work with more complicated inputs, please see this documentation

Importantly, the name, description, and JSON schema (if used) are all used in the prompt. Therefore, it is really important that they are clear and describe exactly how the tool should be used. You may need to change the default name, description, or JSON schema if the LLM is not understanding how to use the tool.


```python
# Python Example
from langchain.tools import Tool

# Define a simple function to be triggered by the agent
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Wrap the function in a Tool
greet_tool = Tool(
    name="greet",
    func=greet,
    description="Greets the user with their name. Use this tool when the input starts with 'greet <name>'."
)

# Load tools (in this case, only the greet tool)
tools = [greet_tool]
```


```js
// JavaScript Example
import { DynamicTool } from "@langchain/core/tools";

// Define a simple function to be triggered by the agent
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Wrap the function in a DynamicTool (Tool has some problems in javascript)
const greetTool = new DynamicTool({
    name: "greet",
    description: "Greets the user with their name. Use this tool when the input starts with 'greet <name>'.",
    func: greet,
});

// Load tools (in this case, only the greet tool)
const tools = [greetTool]

```

## Agents
Constructs that choose which tools to use given high-level directives

The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.

- **Definition**: Autonomous entities that use LLMs to make decisions and perform tasks.
- **Types**:

    - **Action Agents**: Execute specific actions based on model outputs.
    - **Planning Agents**: Create plans or sequences of actions to achieve a goal.

- **Components**:

    - **Toolkits**: Collections of tools or APIs that agents can use.
    - **Memory**: Mechanisms for maintaining context or state across interactions.

- **Examples**: 

  ```python
  # Python Example
  from langchain import hub
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain.agents import create_react_agent, AgentExecutor
  from langchain.tools import Tool

  # Initialize the ChatOpenAI model
  llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)

  # Define a simple function to be triggered by the agent
  def greet(name):
      return f"Hello, {name}!"

  # Wrap the function in a Tool
  greet_tool = Tool(
      name="greet",
      func=greet,
      description="Greets the user with their name. Use this tool when the input starts with 'greet <name>'."
  )

  # Load tools (in this case, only the greet tool)
  tools = [greet_tool]

  # Define a prompt template for the agent to decide when to call the function
  prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")

  # Create a React agent to handle the function triggering
  agent = create_react_agent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)
  agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
      agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True
  )

  # Define the user input
  input_text = "greet John"

  # Use the agent to process the input and perform actions
  response = agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": input_text
    }
  )

  # Print the response
  print("Agent Response:")
  print(response["output"])

  ```


  ```js
  import { pull } from "langchain/hub";
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
  import { AgentExecutor, createReactAgent } from "langchain/agents"
  import { DynamicTool } from "langchain/tools";


  // Initialize the ChatOpenAI model
  const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKey })


  // Define a simple function to be triggered by the agent
  function greet(name) {
      return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }

  // Wrap the function in a Tool
  const greetTool = new DynamicTool({
      name: "greet",
      description: "Greets the user with their name. Use this tool when the input starts with 'greet <name>'.",
      func: greet,
  });

  // Load tools (in this case, only the greet tool)
  const tools = [greetTool]

  // Define a prompt template for the agent to decide when to call the function
  const prompt = await pull("hwchase17/react");


  // Create a React agent to handle the function triggering
  const agent = await createReactAgent({
      llm,
      tools,
      prompt,
  });

  const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
      agent,
      tools: [greetTool],
  });


  // Define the user input
  const inputText = "greet John"


  // Use the agent to process the input and perform actions

  const result = await agentExecutor
    .invoke({ "input": inputText })

  console.log(result.output)
  ```

   **Input**: 

  ```
  greet John
  ```

 **Output**: 

  ```
  Hello, John!
  ```

## Chains
Building block-style compositions of other runnables

- **Definition**: Sequences of operations where the output of one step serves as the input for the next.
- **Types**:

    - **Simple Chains**: Involve a single call to a language model.
    - **Complex Chains**: Involve multiple steps and can include logic and decision-making.

- **Components**:
  
    - **Links**: Individual steps or operations in the chain.
    - **Flow Control**: Logic that dictates the order and conditions under which steps are executed.

- **Examples**: 


```python
# Python Example
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI model
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)

prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
    template="Use a maximum of 10 words to answer the following question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.  {question}",
    input_variables=["question"],
)

# Create a chain with the model and the prompt template
chain = prompt_template | llm

# Define the user's question
question = "What are the key benefits of using blockchain technology in supply chain management?"

# Generate a response using the chain
response = chain.invoke({"question": question})

print(response)
```

```js
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts"
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

// Initialize the OpenAI model
const llm = new OpenAI({ openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKy })

const promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate({
    template: "Use a maximum of 10 words to answer the following question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.  {question}",
    inputVariables: ["question"],
})

// Create a chain with the model and the prompt template
const chain = RunnableSequence.from([promptTemplate, llm]);

// Define the user's question
const question = "What are the key benefits of using blockchain technology in supply chain management?"

// Generate a response using the chain
const result = await chain
    .invoke({ "question": question })

console.log(result)

```

 **Input**: 

  ```
  What are the key benefits of using blockchain technology in supply chain management?
  ```

 **Output**: 

  ```
 Increased transparency, efficiency, security, and traceability.
  ```

## Memory
![Memory](../img/memory.png)
Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly. A more complex system will need to have a world model that it is constantly updating, which allows it to do things like maintain information about entities and their relationships.

- **Definition**: Components that allow models to maintain state or context over a series of interactions.
- **Types**:

    - **Short-term Memory**: Context retained for a single interaction or session.
    - **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage of information across multiple sessions.

- **Examples**:

    ```python
    # Python Example

    from langchain.prompts import (
        HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
        ChatPromptTemplate,
        MessagesPlaceholder,
    )
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
    from langchain.chains import LLMChain
    from langchain.memory import (
        ConversationSummaryMemory,
    )

    chat = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)


    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["content"],
        messages=[
            MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history"),  # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory
            HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template("{content}"),
        ],
    )

    # Notice that `"chat_history"` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name.
    # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder
    # By using ConversationBufferMemory the full conversation is sent back, ConversationSummaryMemory reduces the amount of token needed
    memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(
        memory_key="chat_history",
        return_messages=True,
        llm=chat,
    )

    chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=prompt, memory=memory, verbose=False)

    def create_chat(content):
        result = chain.invoke({"content": content})
        return result["text"]

    ```

    ```js
    // JavaScript Example

    import {
        HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
        ChatPromptTemplate,
        MessagesPlaceholder,
    } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

    import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
    import { LLMChain } from "langchain/chains";
    import { ConversationSummaryMemory } from "langchain/memory";


    const chat = new ChatOpenAI({
        openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKey,
    });

    const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
        new MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"), // The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory
        HumanMessagePromptTemplate.fromTemplate("{content}"),
    ]);

    // Notice that `"chat_history"` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name.
    // Notice that we `returnMessages=true` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder
    // By using ConversationBufferMemory the full conversation is sent back, ConversationSummaryMemory reduces the amount of token needed
    const memory = new ConversationSummaryMemory({
        memoryKey: "chat_history",
        returnMessages: true,
        llm: chat,
    });

    const chain = new LLMChain({ llm: chat, prompt, memory, verbose: false });

    export async function createChat(text) {
        return await chain
            .invoke({ content: text })
            .then((finalResult) => {
                return finalResult.text;
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                return `error ${error}`;
            });
    }

    ```

## Callbacks
LangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks.

You can subscribe to these events by using the callbacks argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail.




- **Definition**: Mechanisms that allow developers to hook into various stages of the chain execution process.
- **Uses**:

    - **Logging**: Recording information about the execution process.
    - **Monitoring**: Observing the performance and behavior of the system.
    - **Modifying Behavior**: Dynamically changing the execution based on certain conditions.

- **Examples**:


```python
# Python Example

from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler


class MyCallbackHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
    name = "MyCallbackHandler"

    def on_chain_start(self, serialized, inputs, **kwargs):
        print('========= Chain start =========\n')
        print(f'Input: {inputs}\n')

    def on_chain_end(self, outputs, **kwargs):
        print('========= Chain end =========\n')
        print(f'Output: {outputs}\n')

    def on_llm_start(self, _llm, prompt, **kwargs):
        print('========= LLM start =========\n')
        print(f'Template: "{prompt}"\n')


    def on_llm_end(self, output, **kwargs):
        print('========= LLM end =========\n')
        print(f'Output: {output}\n')


handler = MyCallbackHandler()
llm = OpenAI()
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Return the value of the calculation: 1 + {number} = ")

chain = prompt | llm
chain.invoke({"number": 4}, {"callbacks": [handler]})
```

```js
// JavaScript Example
 
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts"
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";


class MyCallbackHandler {
    name = "MyCallbackHandler";
    async handleLLMStart(_llm, prompt) {
        console.log('========= LLM start =========\n');
        console.log(`Template: "${prompt}"\n`)
    }
    async handleLLMEnd(output) {
        console.log('========= LLM end =========\n');
        console.log(`Answer: ${output.generations[0][0].text}\n`)
    }

    async handleChainStart(_chain, input) {
        console.log('========= Chain start =========\n');
        console.log(`Input: ${JSON.stringify(input)}\n`)
    }
    async handleChainEnd(outputs) {
        console.log('========= Chain end =========\n');
        console.log(`Output: ${JSON.stringify(outputs)}\n`)
    }

}

const handler = new MyCallbackHandler();
const llm = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0, callbacks: [handler], openAIApiKey: yourOpenAiApiKy });
const promptTemplate = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate("Return the value of the calculation: 1 + {number} =");
const chain = RunnableSequence.from([promptTemplate, llm]);
await chain.invoke({ number: 4 }, { callbacks: [handler] });


```

**Output**: 

```
========= Chain start =========

Input: {'number': 4}

========= Chain end =========

Output: text='Return the value of the calculation: 1 + 4 = '

========= LLM start =========

Template: "['Return the value of the calculation: 1 + 4 = ']"

# risks

# Risks of Adopting LangChain Right Now


1.  **Relative Immaturity**:
    -   LangChain is a relatively new framework, having been introduced in 2022. As a result, it may not have the same level of maturity, stability, and community support as some more established frameworks and libraries.
    -   The documentation, examples, and resources available for LangChain may not be as comprehensive or well-developed compared to more mature tools.
2.  **Limited Ecosystem Integration**:
    -   LangChain is primarily focused on providing a set of abstractions and tools for building language model-powered applications. However, its integration with other popular machine learning and data processing frameworks may not be as seamless as some users might expect.
    -   Developers may need to spend more time and effort to integrate LangChain with their existing toolchain and infrastructure.
3.  **Performance Concerns**:
    -   While LangChain aims to provide a high-level, user-friendly interface for working with language models, there may be some performance overhead or limitations compared to directly working with the underlying language model libraries.
    -   For applications with strict performance requirements, the additional abstraction layer provided by LangChain may not be the optimal choice.
4.  **Limited Language Support**:
    -   Currently, LangChain is primarily focused on supporting Python and JavaScript. Developers working with other programming languages may not be able to take advantage of the LangChain ecosystem and may need to explore alternative solutions.
5.  **Vendor Lock-in Concerns**:
    -   LangChain is closely tied to the OpenAI ecosystem, with a strong focus on integrating with OpenAI's language models and APIs. This may raise concerns about vendor lock-in for some users who prefer to work with a more diverse set of language model providers.
6.  **Lack of Widespread Adoption**:
    -   As a relatively new framework, LangChain may not have achieved the same level of widespread adoption and community support as some other well-established tools in the natural language processing and machine learning domains.
    -   This could make it more challenging to find pre-built solutions, community resources, and experienced developers familiar with LangChain.
7.  **Rapid Evolution**:
    -   Frequent Updates: LangChain, being a new technology, might undergo frequent updates that could necessitate continuous learning and adaptation.
    -   Backward Compatibility: Rapid changes may lead to backward compatibility issues, requiring regular codebase updates.

# python-vs-js

# Difference Between Adopting Python and JavaScript

1. **Python**:
    - Python is the original language for LangChain and has the most comprehensive and mature support.
    - The Python ecosystem has a wide range of well-established libraries and tools for natural language processing, machine learning, and data manipulation, which can integrate well with LangChain.
    - Python is a popular language for data science, machine learning, and AI-related projects, making it a natural choice for LangChain development.
    - The Python version of LangChain provides more features, examples, and documentation compared to the JavaScript version.

2. **JavaScript**:
    - JavaScript is a popular language for web development and has a large and active community.
    - The JavaScript version of LangChain allows you to build LangChain applications that can be easily integrated into web-based applications or Node.js environments.
    - JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both client-side and server-side development, making it a good choice for building end-to-end applications with LangChain.
    - The JavaScript version of LangChain is relatively newer and may have fewer features and less documentation compared to the Python version, but it's actively being developed and improved.

## Why Python

1. **Maturity and Ecosystem Support**:
    - The Python version of LangChain has been around longer and has a more mature and comprehensive set of features, examples, and documentation.
    - The Python ecosystem has a wider range of well-established libraries and tools for natural language processing, machine learning, and data manipulation that can integrate seamlessly with LangChain.
    - The JavaScript version of LangChain is relatively newer and may have fewer features and less community support compared to the Python version.
2. **Performance and Efficiency**:
    - Python is generally considered more efficient and performant than JavaScript, especially for numerical and scientific computing tasks.
    - Some of the underlying libraries and models used in LangChain may have better performance and optimization in their Python implementations compared to their JavaScript counterparts.
3. **Deployment and Integration**:
    - Python is a more widely adopted language in the machine learning and AI domains, which may make it easier to deploy and integrate LangChain-based applications in production environments.
    - The Python ecosystem has more established tools and best practices for packaging, distributing, and deploying machine learning models and applications.
4. **Tooling and Debugging**:
    - The Python ecosystem has more mature and feature-rich tooling for tasks like code editing, debugging, and profiling, which can make the development process more efficient.
    - The JavaScript ecosystem is rapidly evolving, but some developers may find the tooling and debugging experience in Python to be more streamlined and reliable.
5. **Data Handling and Manipulation**:
    - Python has a strong set of libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas) for efficient data handling and manipulation, which can be beneficial for certain LangChain use cases.
    - The JavaScript ecosystem is catching up in this area, but may still lack some of the advanced data processing capabilities found in the Python ecosystem.

## Why JavaScript

1. **Web Integration**:
    - JavaScript is inherently designed for web development, making it easier to integrate with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and various front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue).
    - Python, while versatile, requires additional frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask) to handle web development tasks, adding complexity to the development process.
2. **Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming**:
    - JavaScript is built with a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it highly efficient for I/O-bound tasks and real-time applications.
    - Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a bottleneck for CPU-bound concurrent tasks, although libraries like asyncio and multiprocessing mitigate this to some extent.
3. **Performance in Client-Side Applications**:
    - JavaScript runs natively in web browsers, providing direct interaction with the DOM and enabling rich client-side applications.
    - Python is not natively supported in web browsers, requiring tools like Pyodide or Brython to run Python code on the client side, which can introduce performance overhead.
4. **Deployment in Serverless Architectures**:
    - JavaScript (Node.js) is often preferred for serverless functions and microservices due to its lightweight nature and fast cold start times.
    - Python functions in serverless environments (e.g., AWS Lambda) may experience slower cold starts, affecting the responsiveness of applications.
5. **Community and Ecosystem for Web Development**:
    - JavaScript has a vast and active community focused on web development, with numerous libraries, frameworks, and tools specifically designed for building web applications.
    - Python's community is more diversified across different domains (e.g., data science, machine learning, web development), which can lead to a less concentrated focus on web-specific tools and frameworks.

## Alternative Solution: Interoperability

1. **Cross-language interoperability**:
    - Exploring tools and techniques to enable interoperability between Python and JavaScript can be beneficial for leveraging the strengths of both ecosystems.
2. **API Development**:
    - Using Python for core LangChain functionalities while utilizing JavaScript for frontend interfaces can create a robust, scalable solution.

## Code Examples

### Python

```py
from langchain.prompts import (

# language-barrier

# Language Barrier in Generative AI

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, generative AI (GenAI) has shown promising advancements, transforming how we interact with technology across various sectors including education, legal, healthcare, and more. Despite these advancements, a significant challenge persists: the underrepresentation of global languages.

## The Problem of Linguistic Diversity

Generative AI systems like **GPT-4** and **Google Gemini** have been primarily trained on dominant languages, notably English. This training bias results in a lack of support for many of the world's 7,000 languages. This not only limits the technology's usability across different linguistic demographics but also raises concerns about cultural and linguistic equity.

## Impacts of Language Limitation

The consequences of this limitation are far-reaching. In regions like **Odisha**, India, students face difficulties using AI tools for research in their native language, Odia. The problem extends to critical services such as legal assistance and healthcare, where inaccurate translations by AI have led to serious miscommunications and errors.

## The Technological and Social Divide

AI's language gap exacerbates existing social and economic divisions, as noted by researchers and critics. The majority of AI development benefits those who speak popular languages, sidelining billions who do not. This creates a digital divide, hindering equal access to technological advancements and perpetuating global inequalities.

## Efforts to Address the Language Gap

Organizations and researchers are beginning to address these disparities. Initiatives to train AI systems on low-resource languages and the publication of research and tools in multiple languages are steps toward inclusivity. For instance, some AI models are now being developed to better understand and generate text in languages like Māori and Kazakh, which have traditionally been overlooked.

## Case Studies and Success Stories

Highlighting real-world examples of successful efforts can provide tangible evidence of progress and inspire further action. Specific initiatives, such as those by the Mozilla Foundation or regional universities, have made significant strides in improving AI's linguistic capabilities. For instance, efforts to digitize and integrate Māori language into AI systems have shown promising results, serving as a model for other underrepresented languages.

## Future Directions

The path forward involves more than just technical solutions; it requires a concerted effort from governments, technology companies, and the global community. Expanding the linguistic capabilities of AI systems not only improves functionality but also ensures fairness in AI applications. Collaborative projects, increased funding for linguistic research, and inclusive policy-making are essential steps in this direction.

## Conclusion

As AI continues to integrate into every aspect of our lives, the need for linguistic inclusivity becomes more urgent. Bridging the AI language gap is not just a technical challenge but a moral imperative to ensure that no language, and thus no community, is left behind in the digital age.




# technical-challenges

# Technical challenges in Multilingual Processing

As generative AI technology continues to advance, its potential applications expand across various fields, including education, healthcare, legal services, and more. However, despite these advancements, generative AI systems face significant challenges when it comes to processing and generating text in multiple languages. The complexity of linguistic diversity presents unique obstacles that can hinder the effectiveness and inclusivity of AI technologies.

This page explores the key challenges generative AI encounters in multilingual processing. From handling complex grammatical structures and non-Latin scripts to addressing semantic nuances and tonal variations, each language presents distinct hurdles that require sophisticated solutions. Additionally, the lack of training data for many languages exacerbates these issues, further highlighting the need for comprehensive and inclusive AI development. By understanding these challenges, we can better appreciate the efforts required to create truly global and equitable AI systems.

## Languages with Complex Grammatical Structures
Languages that have complex syntax, morphology, or tonal systems are challenging for AI. For example, agglutinative languages like Basque or Finnish, or tonal languages like Vietnamese and Yoruba, require more sophisticated processing algorithms.

- **Example**: Finnish, an agglutinative language spoken in Finland, attaches numerous suffixes to words, creating long compound words. This structure poses significant challenges for natural language processing tasks like tokenization and grammatical analysis in AI models. 
For instance, the word "**epäjärjestelmällistyttämättömyydellänsäkään**" means "not even by his/her lack of organization." The complexity and length of such words make it difficult for AI to accurately tokenize and analyze the grammatical components.

## Languages with Non-Latin Scripts
Languages that use scripts other than Latin, such as Arabic, Chinese, and many Indian scripts like Devanagari (used for Hindi), have additional challenges related to text processing and character recognition.

- **Example**: Arabic uses a script that is written right-to-left and includes extensive use of diacritics, which can alter the meaning of words. These features, combined with widespread regional dialects and variations, complicate text recognition and processing for AI.
For instance, the word **"علَم"** can mean "flag" or "science" depending on the placement of diacritics. The inclusion of diacritics like the small marks above or below letters (e.g., "عَلَم" versus "عِلم") significantly changes the meaning, making accurate text recognition and processing a challenge for AI systems.

## Semantic Nuances
Languages are full of nuances in meaning. A single word can have multiple meanings based on context, and phrases or idioms may not translate directly from one language to another. AI models need to capture these semantic subtleties to understand and respond appropriately, which requires sophisticated understanding of context and cultural nuances.

- **Example:** The word "bank" can mean the side of a river or a financial institution, depending on the context. AI models need to discern and apply the correct meaning based on surrounding text.

## Tonal and Phonemic Variations
Some languages, like Mandarin Chinese, are tonal where the meaning of a word can change based on tone. Others have phonemic subtleties that can alter meaning. AI systems must be able to process, understand, and replicate these variations accurately.

- **Example**: Mandarin Chinese uses four main tones, and each tone can change the meaning of a word completely. For instance, the syllable "ma" (妈, 麻, 马, 骂) can mean "mother," "hemp," "horse," or "scold," depending on the tone used. AI models need to accurately identify and generate these tones to understand and produce correct meanings in tonal languages like Mandarin.

## Lack of Training Data
For many languages, especially those spoken by smaller populations or in less digitized regions, there is a lack of comprehensive, high-quality training data. AI models trained predominantly on data-rich languages like English may not perform well on languages for which there is limited or biased data.

- **Example**: Languages like Quechua or Navajo might not have extensive online texts available for training, leading to poorer performance of AI models in these languages compared to more data-rich languages like English or French.

## Script and Orthography
Different languages use different scripts (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese Han characters, Arabic script) and orthographic systems (the set of conventions for writing a language). AI models must be capable of processing and generating text in various scripts and handle orthographic nuances like capitalization and punctuation, which can vary widely across languages.

- **Example:** Arabic script is written right-to-left and includes letters that change shape depending on their position in a word. AI models need to handle such script complexities to process and generate text correctly. For instance, the letter **"ع"**  changes shape based on its position within a word: it appears as "ع" at the beginning (e.g., "عَلَم" – 'flag'), "ـعـ" in the middle (e.g., "معلَم" – 'teacher'), and "ـع" at the end (e.g., "شجاع" – 'brave'). These positional variations add complexity to text processing and generation tasks in AI systems.

## Indigenous Languages
Many indigenous languages around the world lack extensive written literature and digital presence. This includes languages spoken by small populations or in remote areas, such as Ainu in Japan, Navajo in the United States, or Quechua in South America.
   
- **Example:** Navajo, spoken by the Navajo Nation in the southwestern United States, features a complex verb system that is highly agglutinative, making automatic translation and AI understanding particularly challenging due to the rich morphological changes and contextual nuances.

## Minority Languages
These are languages spoken by a minority of the population in a region, often overshadowed by a dominant national language. Examples include Sami languages in Scandinavia, Breton in France, or Tatar in Russia.

- **Example:** Breton, spoken in Brittany, France, is a Celtic language with fewer than 200,000 speakers. Its limited use in daily communication and scarce digital resources make it difficult for AI systems to learn and process Breton effectively.

## Dialects and Regional Variant
Variants and dialects of major languages, which may significantly differ from the standard form used in training data. Examples include Scots dialects of English, or various dialects of Arabic and Spanish, which can vary greatly across different regions.

- **Example:** Andalusian Spanish, a group of dialects spoken in Southern Spain, differs significantly in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar from the standard Castilian Spanish typically used to train AI systems. This results in inaccuracies when AI tools attempt to understand or generate text in Andalusian dialects.

## Internationalization Formats

Internationalization (i18n) presents complex challenges for training large language models (LLMs) within the realm of generative AI. These models need to adeptly handle a diverse array of languages, cultural nuances, and regional formats in the data they process. Achieving proficiency in these areas involves intricate technical implementations and deep cultural insights, which are essential for training inclusive and effective generative AI systems that can understand and process global data inputs accurately.

1. **Date and Time Formats**:
      - **Example**: During training, an LLM must learn to distinguish between date formats such as "**04/05/2023**", recognizing it as **April 5, 2023**, in American formatting or **May 4, 2023**, in European formatting. This distinction is critical to ensure the model correctly interprets the temporal data it encounters.

2. **Numerical Formats**:
      - **Example**: An LLM in training must be equipped to understand that "**1,234**" could mean **one thousand two hundred thirty-four** in a U.S. context or **one point two three four** in a European context. This understanding prevents numerical misinterpretations that could affect the model's performance.

3. **Currency Formats**:
      - **Example**: GenAI models need to identify and contextualize currency values like "**$1,000**" during training, determining whether it refers to **USD, CAD, or AUD**. Proper currency interpretation enhances the model’s financial analytics capabilities across different geographies.

4. **Measurement Units**:
      - **Example**: It's essential for an LLM to discern between different measurement systems during training, such as identifying a **U.S. gallon** versus an **imperial gallon**. Accurate unit interpretation is vital for applications like recipe transformation or scientific data analysis.

5. **Sort Order**:
      - **Example**: Training must include algorithms that recognize and respect the sort order specific to a language, such as **placing "Ö" after "Z"** in Swedish. Correct sorting is crucial for database management and information retrieval tasks managed by GenAI.

6. **Text Direction**:
      - **Example**: GenAI models must be trained to process right-to-left (**RTL**) text direction correctly for languages like Arabic or Hebrew to maintain textual integrity and ensure that processed information is correctly oriented and meaningful.

# Impacts on AI Code Generation

Generative AI technology is revolutionizing code generation, but it faces challenges due to diverse training data, regional coding practices, and prompt specificity. Understanding these factors is essential for developers to ensure accurate and relevant AI-generated code.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Model Training Data

The AI model has been trained on diverse datasets that include text in multiple languages. The responses in each language are influenced by the kind of examples predominantly available in the training data for that language. 

For instance, English datasets may have more contemporary or advanced examples of programming practices due to the prevalence of English-language resources in tech and programming fields.

```python
# Example generated from English training data
import requests

def fetch_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

# Example generated from non-English (older) training data
import urllib.request
import json

def fetch_data(url):
    with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:
        if response.status == 200:
            data = response.read()
            return json.loads(data)
        else:
            return None
```

### Cultural and Regional Variations

Different languages may reflect different regional or cultural practices in coding and software development. 

For example, newer or more sophisticated libraries and frameworks might be more commonly discussed and used in English-speaking communities, which often lead the development of such technologies.

```js
// Example generated from English-speaking region (using newer libraries)
import { format } from 'date-fns';

const formattedDate = format(new Date(), 'MM/dd/yyyy');
console.log(formattedDate);

// Example generated from a different region (using native JavaScript)
const date = new Date();
const formattedDate = date.toLocaleDateString('en-GB');
console.log(formattedDate);
```

### Technology Adoption Rates

Technology adoption and the popularity of certain programming paradigms or libraries can vary regionally. English, being a common language in technology, often gets the latest updates and trends first. 

This means that answers in English might reflect more current practices than answers in languages spoken in regions where technology adoption is slower or different.

```js
// Example generated from prompt in English (suggesting the latest technology)
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_USER = gql`
    query GetUser($id: ID!) {
        user(id: $id) {
            id
            name
            email
        }
    }
`;

function UserComponent({ userId }) {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_USER, { variables: { id: userId } });
    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
    return <div>{data.user.name}</div>;
}

// Example generated from prompt in another language (suggesting an older technology)
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

function getUser(userId) {
    fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data.name))
        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}
```

### Specificity and Clarity of Questions

Sometimes, the way questions are phrased in different languages can lead to differences in responses. Phrasing that is more common or standard in one language might prompt a more detailed or specific answer.

### Training Data Dominance

The AI model is trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, which includes documentation, code samples, and other texts. 

If a significant portion of this data comes from sources that use the "MM/DD/YYYY" format, the model might be biased towards interpreting dates in that format.

```js
// Example where AI assumes "MM/DD/YYYY" format (common in US)
const dateString = "12/06/2024"; // December 6, 2024

// Example where AI assumes "DD/MM/YYYY" format (common in Europe)
const dateString = "12/06/2024"; // June 12, 2024
```

### Language and Localization

The language in which a query is asked can influence the AI's assumptions about regional conventions. 

For instance, queries in English might be more likely to be interpreted with American date formatting conventions, especially if the model detects that the user is from a region where this format is standard.

```python
# Prompt in English leading to US date format
from datetime import datetime

date_string = "12/06/2024"
date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%m/%d/%Y")
print(date_object)

# Prompt in Spanish leading to European date format
from datetime import datetime

date_string = "12/06/2024"
date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d/%m/%Y")
print(date_object)
```

### Contextual Cues

The AI relies on contextual information to disambiguate formats. In cases where the context is not clear or is ambiguous, the model might default to a more common or familiar format based on its training data. 

Without explicit context indicating otherwise, the AI may apply the most statistically likely interpretation.

```js

// Prompt:
// Write a function to convert a date string "12/06/2024"
// to a date object in JavaScript.

// Ambiguous interpretation of the date format
function convertDate(dateString) {
    // Without clear context, the AI might assume MM/DD/YYYY
    const [month, day, year] = dateString.split('/');
    return new Date(year, month - 1, day);
}

const dateObject = convertDate("12/06/2024");
console.log(dateObject); // Might output December 6, 2024

// Prompt:
// Write a function to convert a date string "12/06/2024" (in DD/MM/YYYY format)
// to a date object in JavaScript.

// Clear interpretation of the date format
function convertDate(dateString) {
    // With explicit context, the AI correctly interprets DD/MM/YYYY
    const [day, month, year] = dateString.split('/');
    return new Date(year, month - 1, day);
}

const dateObject = convertDate("12/06/2024");
console.log(dateObject); // Outputs June 12, 2024

```

### Bias in Implementation

Developers and AI practitioners who create these systems might introduce biases based on their own regional norms and practices. 

If the developers primarily come from regions using "MM/DD/YYYY" formatting, this could influence the design choices in the AI's parsing logic.

```python
# Developer from the US influencing AI to use "MM/DD/YYYY"
date_string = "12/06/2024"
date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%m/%d/%Y")
print(date_object)

# Developer from Europe influencing AI to use "DD/MM/YYYY"
date_string = "12/06/2024"
date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d/%m/%Y")
print(date_object)
```

## Risk Mitigations

### Adopt English for Prompts

1. **Prevalence in Training Data**: English is often the dominant language in AI training datasets, especially for technical content like programming. This means the AI is more likely to generate accurate and up-to-date code when prompted in English.
2. **Technical Terminology**: Much of the technical terminology and documentation is originally written in English, making it easier to describe programming concepts and requirements precisely.
3. **Standardization**: Using a single language for prompts can standardize the input, reducing the chances of regional biases and improving the consistency of AI-generated code.
4. **Community and Resources**: The programming community and resources (such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, and official documentation) are predominantly in English, providing a richer context for the AI to draw from.

### Follow Best Practices

1. **Prompt Design Guidelines**:
      - **Provide Clear Guidelines**: Offer users detailed guidelines on how to phrase their prompts clearly and unambiguously. This includes examples of well-structured prompts and common pitfalls to avoid.
      - **Use Structured Formats**: Encourage the use of structured formats or templates for prompts to ensure all necessary details are included, such as specifying libraries, frameworks, versions, and regional conventions explicitly.

2. **Enhanced Context Understanding**:
      - **Contextual Prompts**: Advise users to include relevant context within their prompts. For instance, specifying the desired date format (e.g., "DD/MM/YYYY" or "MM/DD/YYYY") can help the AI interpret dates correctly.
      - **Examples and Edge Cases**: Ask users to provide examples or edge cases within their prompts to give the AI a clearer understanding of the expected output.

3. **Language-Specific Instructions**:
      - **Localized Prompt Examples**: Provide examples of prompts in different languages and explain how to phrase questions clearly in each language, considering regional conventions and idiomatic expressions.
      - **Avoid Ambiguity**: Encourage users to avoid ambiguous terms and provide precise instructions. For example, instead of saying "next month," specify the exact month.

4. **Feedback and Iteration**:
      - **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism where users can report unclear or incorrect responses. Use this feedback to continuously improve the AI’s ability to understand and respond to specific and clear prompts.
      - **Iterative Refinement**: Encourage users to refine their prompts iteratively based on the initial AI responses, making adjustments to improve clarity and specificity.




# overview

# Prompt Engineering and Fine Tuning

**Introduction**

In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), software engineers frequently utilize prompt engineering and fine-tuning to tailor AI systems to specific tasks. These two techniques are essential for optimizing the performance of generative AI models like GPT-4 and PaLM 2 across various applications. This article delves into the detailed practices, differences, and similarities of these methodologies, providing software engineers with the tools to apply these strategies effectively.

## Understanding Prompt Engineering and Fine Tuning

**Prompt Engineering** involves crafting specific input queries to guide the output of AI models effectively. This technique does not modify the model itself but optimizes how it interprets and responds to inputs.

**Fine Tuning** adjusts the internal parameters of an AI model by continuing its training on a narrowly focused dataset. This method tailors the model to perform well on specific tasks by optimizing its understanding and response capabilities according to the additional training data.

### Similarities

Both prompt engineering and fine tuning are used to:

- Enhance the performance and accuracy of AI models.
- Adapt models to better serve specific user requirements or tasks.
- Ensure AI outputs are more relevant and contextually appropriate.

### Differences

- **Objective Focus**: Prompt engineering aims primarily to manipulate the input to get desired outputs, while fine-tuning changes the model's internal settings to improve task-specific performance.
- **Technical Approach**: Prompt engineering works by refining the way questions are posed to the model, requiring no changes to the model’s architecture. Fine-tuning involves re-training the model on new data to adjust its learned behaviors and biases.
- **Resource Intensity**: Prompt engineering is typically less resource-intensive as it involves no additional model training. Fine-tuning requires significant computational power and data for training.
- **Control versus Autonomy**: With prompt engineering, the user retains full control over the output through careful crafting of the input. Fine-tuning delegates more decision-making to the AI by enhancing its internal decision processes.

**Best Practices in Detail**

**Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**

1. **Precision and Clarity**: Design prompts that are unambiguous and directly related to the desired output. Clear, concise prompts reduce the chance of misinterpretation.
2. **Context Inclusion**: Always include sufficient context in prompts to guide the AI more accurately, especially when dealing with complex or niche subjects.
3. **Iterative Testing**: Continuously test and refine prompts based on output quality. Use a trial-and-error method to determine what types of prompts yield the best results.
4. **Template Utilization**: Develop and use templates for frequently encountered prompt scenarios. This standardizes the inputs and ensures consistency across similar tasks.

**Fine Tuning Best Practices:**

1. **High-Quality Data**: Ensure that the data used for fine-tuning is of high quality, relevant, and closely represents the real-world scenarios the model will address.
2. **Avoid Overfitting**: Be cautious of overfitting by using techniques like regularization, and validate the model with independent datasets to ensure it performs well on general as well as specific tasks.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Incorporate feedback loops that allow the model to learn from its mistakes through human oversight and corrections. This enhances the model’s accuracy over time.
4. **Gradual Adjustments**: Apply fine-tuning gradually, adjusting training parameters and datasets based on ongoing results and performance metrics.

# Prompt Engineering Best Practices

This document highlights effective strategies for designing prompts that guide AI models to generate optimal responses. The focus is on clear instructions, relevant context, and examples to ensure the model's performance meets user expectations.

In order to try different setting it's possible to use:

- [ChatGPT Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat)

- Python:

    ```python
    from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
    from langchain_openai import OpenAI

    llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)

    system = "When I ask for help to write something, you will reply with a document that contains at least one joke or playful comment in every paragraph."

    user = "Write a thank you note to my steel bolt vendor for getting the delivery in on time and in short notice. This made it possible for us to deliver an important order."

    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
        [
            (
                "system",
                system,
            ),
            ("human", "{user}"),
        ]
    )

    chain = prompt | llm

    result = chain.invoke({"user": user})

    print(result)
    ```

- Javascript: 

    ```js
    import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
    import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts"
    import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

    const llm = new OpenAI({
        apiKey: yourOpenAiApiKey,
    });

    const system = "When I ask for help to write something, you will reply with a document that contains at least one joke or playful comment in every paragraph."

    const user = "Write a thank you note to my steel bolt vendor for getting the delivery in on time and in short notice. This made it possible for us to deliver an important order."

    const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
        ["system", system],
        ["human", "{user}"],
    ]);

    const chain = RunnableSequence.from([prompt, llm]);

    const result = await chain.invoke({ user: user });

    console.log(result);
    ```


You can also explore example prompts which showcase what our models are capable of:

## Write clear instructions

These models can’t read your mind. If outputs are too long, ask for brief replies. If outputs are too simple, ask for expert-level writing. If you dislike the format, demonstrate the format you’d like to see. The less the model has to guess at what you want, the more likely you’ll get it.

### Include details in your query to get more relevant answers
In order to get a highly relevant response, make sure that requests provide any important details or context. Otherwise you are leaving it up to the model to guess what you mean.

| Worse                                           | Better                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How do I add numbers in Excel?                  | How do I add up a row of dollar amounts in Excel? I want to do this automatically for a whole sheet of rows with all the totals ending up on the right in a column called "Total".                          |
| Who’s president?                                | Who was the president of Mexico in 2021, and how frequently are elections held?                                                                                                                             |
| Write code to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. | Write a TypeScript function to efficiently calculate the Fibonacci sequence. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way.                                      |
| Summarize the meeting notes.                    | Summarize the meeting notes in a single paragraph. Then write a markdown list of the speakers and each of their key points. Finally, list the next steps or action items suggested by the speakers, if any. |


### Ask the model to adopt a persona
The system message can be used to specify the persona used by the model in its replies.


```

SYSTEM: When I ask for help to write something, you will reply with a document that contains at least one joke or playful comment in every paragraph.
USER:   Write a thank you note to my steel bolt vendor for getting the delivery in on time and in short notice. This made it possible for us to deliver an important order.

```

### Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input

Delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, section titles, etc. can help demarcate sections of text to be treated differently.

```
USER:   Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes with a haiku.
        """insert text here"""
```

```
SYSTEM: You will be provided with a pair of articles (delimited with XML tags) about the same topic. First summarize the arguments of each article. Then indicate which of them makes a better argument and explain why.
USER:   <article> insert first article here </article>
        <article> insert second article here </article>
```

```
SYSTEM: You will be provided with a thesis abstract and a suggested title for it. The thesis title should give the reader a good idea of the topic of the thesis but should also be eye-catching. If the title does not meet these criteria, suggest 5 alternatives.
USER:   Abstract: insert abstract here
        Title: insert title here
```

For straightforward tasks such as these, using delimiters might not make a difference in the output quality. However, the more complex a task is the more important it is to disambiguate task details. Don’t make the model work to understand exactly what you are asking of them.

### Specify the steps required to complete a task

Some tasks are best specified as a sequence of steps. Writing the steps out explicitly can make it easier for the model to follow them.

```
SYSTEM: Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs.
        Step 1 - The user will provide you with text in triple quotes. Summarize this text in one sentence with a prefix that says "Summary: ".
        Step 2 - Translate the summary from Step 1 into Spanish, with a prefix that says "Translation: ".
USER:   """insert text here"""
```

### Provide examples

Providing general instructions that apply to all examples is generally more efficient than demonstrating all permutations of a task by example, but in some cases providing examples may be easier. For example, if you intend for the model to copy a particular style of responding to user queries which is difficult to describe explicitly. This is known as "few-shot" prompting.

```

SYSTEM:    Answer in a consistent style.
USER:      Teach me about patience.
ASSISTANT: The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.
USER:      Teach me about the ocean.

```

### Specify the desired length of the output

You can ask the model to produce outputs that are of a given target length. The targeted output length can be specified in terms of the count of words, sentences, paragraphs, bullet points, etc. Note however that instructing the model to generate a specific number of words does not work with high precision. The model can more reliably generate outputs with a specific number of paragraphs or bullet points.

```
USER:  Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in about 50 words.
       """insert text here"""
```

```
USER:  Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in 2 paragraphs.
       """insert text here"""
```

```
USER:  Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in 3 bullet points.
       """insert text here"""
```

## Provide reference text

Language models can confidently invent fake answers, especially when asked about esoteric topics or for citations and URLs. In the same way that a sheet of notes can help a student do better on a test, providing reference text to these models can help in answering with fewer fabrications.


### Instruct the model to answer using a reference text

If we can provide a model with trusted information that is relevant to the current query, then we can instruct the model to use the provided information to compose its answer.

```
SYSTEM: Use the provided articles delimited by triple quotes to answer questions. If the answer cannot be found in the articles, write "I could not find an answer."
USER:   <insert articles, each delimited by triple quotes>
        Question: <insert question here>
```

Given that all models have limited context windows, we need some way to dynamically lookup information that is relevant to the question being asked.

### Instruct the model to answer with citations from a reference text

If the input has been supplemented with relevant knowledge, it's straightforward to request that the model add citations to its answers by referencing passages from provided documents. Note that citations in the output can then be verified programmatically by string matching within the provided documents.

```
SYSTEM: You will be provided with a document delimited by triple quotes and a question. Your task is to answer the question using only the provided document and to cite the passage(s) of the document used to answer the question. If the document does not contain the information needed to answer this question then simply write: "Insufficient information." If an answer to the question is provided, it must be annotated with a citation. Use the following format for to cite relevant passages ({"citation": …}).
USER:   """<insert document here>"""
        Question: <insert question here>
```


## Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks


Just as it is good practice in software engineering to decompose a complex system into a set of modular components, the same is true of tasks submitted to a language model. Complex tasks tend to have higher error rates than simpler tasks. Furthermore, complex tasks can often be re-defined as a workflow of simpler tasks in which the outputs of earlier tasks are used to construct the inputs to later tasks.

### Use intent classification to identify the most relevant instructions for a user query

For tasks in which lots of independent sets of instructions are needed to handle different cases, it can be beneficial to first classify the type of query and to use that classification to determine which instructions are needed. This can be achieved by defining fixed categories and hardcoding instructions that are relevant for handling tasks in a given category. This process can also be applied recursively to decompose a task into a sequence of stages. The advantage of this approach is that each query will contain only those instructions that are required to perform the next stage of a task which can result in lower error rates compared to using a single query to perform the whole task. This can also result in lower costs since larger prompts cost more to run. 

Suppose for example that for a customer service application, queries could be usefully classified as follows:

```
SYSTEM: You will be provided with customer service queries. Classify each query into a primary category and a secondary category. Provide your output in json format with the keys: primary and secondary.

        Primary categories: Billing, Technical Support, Account Management, or General Inquiry.

        Billing secondary categories:
        - Unsubscribe or upgrade
        - Add a payment method
        - Explanation for charge
        - Dispute a charge

        Technical Support secondary categories:
        - Troubleshooting
        - Device compatibility
        - Software updates

        Account Management secondary categories:
        - Password reset
        - Update personal information
        - Close account
        - Account security

        General Inquiry secondary categories:
        - Product information
        - Pricing
        - Feedback
        - Speak to a human

USER:   I need to get my internet working again.
```

Based on the classification of the customer query, a set of more specific instructions can be provided to a model for it to handle next steps. For example, suppose the customer requires help with "troubleshooting".

```
SYSTEM: You will be provided with customer service inquiries that require troubleshooting in a technical support context. Help the user by:

        - Ask them to check that all cables to/from the router are connected. Note that it is common for cables to come loose over time.
        - If all cables are connected and the issue persists, ask them which router model they are using
        - Now you will advise them how to restart their device:

USER:   I need to get my internet working again.
```

Notice that the model has been instructed to emit special strings to indicate when the state of the conversation changes. This enables us to turn our system into a state machine where the state determines which instructions are injected. By keeping track of state, what instructions are relevant at that state, and also optionally what state transitions are allowed from that state, we can put guardrails around the user experience that would be hard to achieve with a less structured approach.

### For dialogue applications that require very long conversations, summarize or filter previous dialogue

Since models have a fixed context length, dialogue between a user and an assistant in which the entire conversation is included in the context window cannot continue indefinitely.

There are various workarounds to this problem, one of which is to summarize previous turns in the conversation. Once the size of the input reaches a predetermined threshold length, this could trigger a query that summarizes part of the conversation and the summary of the prior conversation could be included as part of the system message. Alternatively, prior conversation could be summarized asynchronously in the background throughout the entire conversation.

An alternative solution is to dynamically select previous parts of the conversation that are most relevant to the current query. See the tactic [Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval](#use-embeddings-based-search-to-implement-efficient-knowledge-retrieval).

### Summarize long documents piecewise and construct a full summary recursively

Since models have a fixed context length, they cannot be used to summarize a text longer than the context length minus the length of the generated summary in a single query.

To summarize a very long document such as a book we can use a sequence of queries to summarize each section of the document. Section summaries can be concatenated and summarized producing summaries of summaries. This process can proceed recursively until an entire document is summarized. If it’s necessary to use information about earlier sections in order to make sense of later sections, then a further trick that can be useful is to include a running summary of the text that precedes any given point in the book while summarizing content at that point. 

## Give the model time to "think"

If asked to multiply 17 by 28, you might not know it instantly, but can still work it out with time. Similarly, models make more reasoning errors when trying to answer right away, rather than taking time to work out an answer. Asking for a "chain of thought" before an answer can help the model reason its way toward correct answers more reliably.

### Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

Sometimes we get better results when we explicitly instruct the model to reason from first principles before coming to a conclusion. Suppose for example we want a model to evaluate a student’s solution to a math problem. The most obvious way to approach this is to simply ask the model if the student's solution is correct or not.

```
SYSTEM:     Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

USER:       Problem Statement: I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials.
            - Land costs $100 / square foot
            - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
            - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
            What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet.

            Student's Solution: Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
            1. Land cost: 100x
            2. Solar panel cost: 250x
            3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
            Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000

ASSISTANT:  The student's solution is correct.
```

But the student's solution is actually not correct! We can get the model to successfully notice this by prompting the model to generate its own solution first.

``` hl_lines="3"
SYSTEM:     First work out your own solution to the problem. 
            Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
            Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.

USER:       Problem Statement: I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials.
            - Land costs $100 / square foot
            - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
            - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
            What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet.

            Student's Solution: Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
            1. Land cost: 100x
            2. Solar panel cost: 250x
            3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
            Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000

ASSISTANT:  Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
            1. Land cost: 100x
            2. Solar panel cost: 250x
            3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 10x
            Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x = 360x + 100,000

            The student's solution is incorrect. They made an error in the maintenance cost calculation, using 100x instead of 10x. The correct total cost for the first year of operations is 360x + 100,000.
```

### Use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process

The previous tactic demonstrates that it is sometimes important for the model to reason in detail about a problem before answering a specific question. For some applications, the reasoning process that a model uses to arrive at a final answer would be inappropriate to share with the user. For example, in tutoring applications we may want to encourage students to work out their own answers, but a model’s reasoning process about the student’s solution could reveal the answer to the student.

Inner monologue is a tactic that can be used to mitigate this. The idea of inner monologue is to instruct the model to put parts of the output that are meant to be hidden from the user into a structured format that makes parsing them easy. Then before presenting the output to the user, the output is parsed and only part of the output is made visible.

```
SYSTEM: Follow these steps to answer the user queries.

        Step 1 - First work out your own solution to the problem. Don't rely on the student's solution since it may be incorrect. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes (""").

        Step 2 - Compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes (""").

        Step 3 - If the student made a mistake, determine what hint you could give the student without giving away the answer. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes (""").

        Step 4 - If the student made a mistake, provide the hint from the previous step to the student (outside of triple quotes). Instead of writing "Step 4 - ..." write "Hint:".

USER:   Problem Statement: <insert problem statement>
        Student Solution: <insert student solution>
```

Alternatively, this can be achieved with a sequence of queries in which all except the last have their output hidden from the end user.

First, we can ask the model to solve the problem on its own. Since this initial query doesn't require the student’s solution, it can be omitted. This provides the additional advantage that there is no chance that the model’s solution will be biased by the student’s attempted solution.

```
USER:   <insert problem statement>
```

Next, we can have the model use all available information to assess the correctness of the student’s solution.

```
SYSTEM: Compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not.
USER:   Problem statement: """<insert problem statement>"""
        Your solution: """<insert model generated solution>"""
        Student’s solution: """<insert student's solution>"""
```

Finally, we can let the model use its own analysis to construct a reply in the persona of a helpful tutor.

```
SYSTEM: You are a math tutor. If the student made an error, offer a hint to the student in a way that does not reveal the answer. 
        If the student did not make an error, simply offer them an encouraging comment.
USER:   Problem statement: """<insert problem statement>"""
        Your solution: """<insert model generated solution>"""
        Student’s solution: """<insert student's solution>"""
        Analysis: """<insert model generated analysis from previous step>"""
```

### Ask the model if it missed anything on previous passes

Suppose that we are using a model to list excerpts from a source which are relevant to a particular question. After listing each excerpt the model needs to determine if it should start writing another or if it should stop. If the source document is large, it is common for a model to stop too early and fail to list all relevant excerpts. In that case, better performance can often be obtained by prompting the model with followup queries to find any excerpts it missed on previous passes.

```
SYSTEM:     You will be provided with a document delimited by triple quotes. Your task is to select excerpts which pertain to the following question: "What significant paradigm shifts have occurred in the history of artificial intelligence."

            Ensure that excerpts contain all relevant context needed to interpret them - in other words don't extract small snippets that are missing important context. Provide output in JSON format as follows:

            [{"excerpt": "..."},
            ...
            {"excerpt": "..."}]

USER:       """<insert document here>"""

ASSISTANT:  [{"excerpt": "the model writes an excerpt here"},
            ...
            {"excerpt": "the model writes another excerpt here"}]

USER:       Are there more relevant excerpts? Take care not to repeat excerpts. Also ensure that excerpts contain all relevant context needed to interpret them - in other words don't extract small snippets that are missing important context.
```

## Use external tools

Compensate for the weaknesses of the model by feeding it the outputs of other tools. For example, a text retrieval SYSTEM (sometimes called RAG or retrieval augmented generation) can tell the model about relevant documents. A code execution engine like OpenAI's Code Interpreter can help the model do math and run code. If a task can be done more reliably or efficiently by a tool rather than by a language model, offload it to get the best of both.


### Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval

A model can leverage external sources of information if provided as part of its input. This can help the model to generate more informed and up-to-date responses. For example, if a user asks a question about a specific movie, it may be useful to add high quality information about the movie (e.g. actors, director, etc…) to the model’s input. Embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval, so that relevant information can be added to the model input dynamically at run-time.

A text embedding is a vector that can measure the relatedness between text strings. Similar or relevant strings will be closer together than unrelated strings. This fact, along with the existence of fast vector search algorithms means that embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval. In particular, a text corpus can be split up into chunks, and each chunk can be embedded and stored. Then a given query can be embedded and vector search can be performed to find the embedded chunks of text from the corpus that are most related to the query (i.e. closest together in the embedding space).

### Use code execution to perform more accurate calculations or call external APIs

Language models cannot be relied upon to perform arithmetic or long calculations accurately on their own. In cases where this is needed, a model can be instructed to write and run code instead of making its own calculations. In particular, a model can be instructed to put code that is meant to be run into a designated format such as triple backtick. After an output is produced, the code can be extracted and run. Finally, if necessary, the output from the code execution engine (i.e. Python interpreter) can be provided as an input to the model for the next query.

```
SYSTEM: You can write and execute Python code by enclosing it in triple backticks, e.g. ```code goes here```. Use this to perform calculations.
USER:   Find all real-valued roots of the following polynomial: 3*x**5 - 5*x**4 - 3*x**3 - 7*x - 10.
```

Another good use case for code execution is calling external APIs. If a model is instructed in the proper use of an API, it can write code that makes use of it. A model can be instructed in how to use an API by providing it with documentation and/or code samples showing how to use the API.

```
SYSTEM: You can write and execute Python code by enclosing it in triple backticks. Also note that you have access to the following module to help users send messages to their friends:

        ```python
        import message
        message.write(to="John", message="Hey, want to meetup after work?")```
```

### Give the model access to specific functions

The Chat Completions API allows passing a list of function descriptions in requests. This enables models to generate function arguments according to the provided schemas. Generated function arguments are returned by the API in JSON format and can be used to execute function calls. Output provided by function calls can then be fed back into a model in the following request to close the loop. 

## Test changes systematically

Improving performance is easier if you can measure it. In some cases a modification to a prompt will achieve better performance on a few isolated examples but lead to worse overall performance on a more representative set of examples. Therefore to be sure that a change is net positive to performance it may be necessary to define a comprehensive test suite (also known an as an "eval").

### Evaluate model outputs with reference to gold-standard answers

Suppose it is known that the correct answer to a question should make reference to a specific set of known facts. Then we can use a model query to count how many of the required facts are included in the answer.

For example, using the following system message:

```
SYSTEM: You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes that is supposed to be the answer to a question. Check if the following pieces of information are directly contained in the answer:

        - Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.
        - The date Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon was July 21, 1969.

        For each of these points perform the following steps:

        1 - Restate the point.
        2 - Provide a citation from the answer which is closest to this point.
        3 - Consider if someone reading the citation who doesn't know the topic could directly infer the point. Explain why or why not before making up your mind.
        4 - Write "yes" if the answer to 3 was yes, otherwise write "no".

        Finally, provide a count of how many "yes" answers there are. Provide this count as {"count": <insert count here>}.
```

Here's an example input where both points are satisfied:

```
SYSTEM: <insert system message above>
USER:   """Neil Armstrong is famous for being the first human to set foot on the Moon. This historic event took place on July 21, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission."""
```

Here's an example input where only one point is satisfied:

```
SYSTEM: <insert system message above>
USER:   """Neil Armstrong made history when he stepped off the lunar module, becoming the first person to walk on the moon."""
```

Here's an example input where none are satisfied:

```
SYSTEM: <insert system message above>
USER:   """In the summer of '69, a voyage grand,
        Apollo 11, bold as legend's hand.
        Armstrong took a step, history unfurled,
        "One small step," he said, for a new world."""
```

# fine-tuning

# Fine-Tuning Best Practices

Fine-tuning generative AI models allows developers to tailor pre-trained models to specific tasks or datasets. This guide provides best practices and coding examples in Python and JavaScript, aiming to help software developers achieve optimal results in their AI projects.

## Selecting the Right Base Model

Selecting the appropriate base model is crucial because it leverages the pre-training on a similar task or dataset, which can drastically reduce the necessary training time and data required for fine-tuning. It ensures that the foundational knowledge is relevant, thereby enhancing learning efficiency and model performance on specialized tasks.

### Example: Selecting a Base Model for Sentiment Analysis

#### Scenario

Suppose you are tasked with developing a sentiment analysis tool that classifies customer reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories. Your dataset consists mainly of short texts from social media posts and online product reviews.

#### Step 1: Define the Requirements

First, understand the specific requirements of your task:

- **Language:** Ensure the model is pre-trained in the same language as your dataset.
- **Domain:** A model trained on similar text types (e.g., informal social media posts) might perform better.
- **Size and Scalability:** Consider the trade-off between model size (number of parameters) and performance, especially if you need to deploy the model in a resource-constrained environment.

#### Step 2: Research Available Models

Explore available pre-trained models that are suitable for NLP tasks. For instance, models like BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa are popular for various text-related tasks. Platforms like Hugging Face provide a wide range of pre-trained models:

- **BERT:** Good for understanding the context of words in a sentence but requires more resources.
- **DistilBERT:** A smaller, faster version of BERT that retains most of its accuracy.
- **RoBERTa:** An optimized version of BERT that often achieves better results on sentiment analysis.

#### Step 3: Evaluate Model Fit
Check if there are domain-specific models available. For example, if a model was pre-trained on product reviews, it might perform better for an e-commerce sentiment analysis task.

#### Step 4: Initial Testing
Before deciding, run some initial tests using a small subset of your data to see how well each model performs out-of-the-box on your specific task. You can use simple metrics like accuracy or F1-score for these preliminary evaluations.

**Python example**
Here's how you might set up a simple test in Python using the Hugging Face `transformers` library to evaluate two models, BERT and RoBERTa, on a small sample of sentiment analysis data.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Sample data
reviews = [
    "I absolutely loved this product!", 
    "Worst purchase I have ever made.",
    "Not sure if I would buy this again."
]

# Load sentiment analysis pipeline with BERT
bert_classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model='bert-base-uncased')
bert_results = bert_classifier(reviews)

# Load sentiment analysis pipeline with RoBERTa
roberta_classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model='roberta-base')
roberta_results = roberta_classifier(reviews)

# Display results
print("BERT Results:", bert_results)
print("RoBERTa Results:", roberta_results)
```

#### Step 5: Decide Based on Performance and Practical Constraints
Based on the test results and factors like computational resources, latency requirements, and ease of integration, select the model that best fits your needs.



## Data Preparation

The quality of training data directly impacts the model's performance. Clean and well-annotated data helps minimize noise, which can otherwise lead to poor model generalization. Proper data preparation ensures that the model learns the relevant features without being misled by errors or irrelevant variations in the data.

**Best Practice:**
Ensure your data is clean, well-annotated, and representative of the use case.

- **Python Example:** Preprocessing text data for a language model.

```python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_text(texts):
    processed_texts = [text.replace('\n', ' ').strip() for text in texts]
    return processed_texts

# Example usage with a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'text': ['First line.\nSecond line.', 'Example text\nNew line.']})
df['processed_text'] = df['text'].apply(preprocess_text)
```

- **JavaScript Example:** Processing text data in Node.js.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function preprocessText(text) {
    return text.replace(/\n/g, ' ').trim();
}

// Example usage reading from a file
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    const processedText = preprocessText(data);
    console.log(processedText);
});
```

## Training Configuration

Configuring these parameters appropriately is key to balancing the training speed and the convergence quality. A too-large learning rate can cause the training to diverge, while a too-small learning rate can make the training process unnecessarily slow. The batch size affects memory usage and model stability during training.

**Best Practice:**
Adjust the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs according to your dataset size and model complexity.



- **Python Example:** Configuring the training parameters in PyTorch.

```python
from torch.optim import AdamW

optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)
epochs = 3
batch_size = 16
```

- **JavaScript Example:** Setting up training parameters in TensorFlow.js.

```javascript
const optimizer = tf.train.adam(0.00005);
const epochs = 3;
const batchSize = 16;
```

## Fine-Tuning Process

Close monitoring allows for adjustments during training, ensuring that the model does not memorize the training data (overfitting) and maintains its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. This is crucial for the model’s practical application outside of the training dataset.


**Best Practice:**
Monitor the training process closely to prevent overfitting and ensure model generalization.



- **Python Example:** Implementing a training loop in PyTorch.

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Assume 'train_features' and 'train_labels' are your input and output features
dataset = TensorDataset(train_features, train_labels)
loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch in loader:
        inputs, labels = batch
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```

- **JavaScript Example:** Training loop in TensorFlow.js.

```javascript
async function train(model, inputs, labels) {
    const dataset = tf.data.array({xs: inputs, ys: labels}).batch(batchSize);

    await model.fitDataset(dataset, {
        epochs: epochs,
        callbacks: {
            onEpochEnd: (epoch, logs) => {
                console.log(`Epoch ${epoch + 1}, Loss: ${logs.loss}`);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

## Evaluation and Iteration

Regular evaluation helps in identifying whether the model is fitting well on the training data without overfitting. Using a separate validation set allows developers to test the model's ability to generalize to new data, which is critical for ensuring the model performs well in real-world scenarios.

**Best Practice:**
Regularly evaluate the model during and after the training process using a validation set to check for performance and generalization.


- **Python Example:** Evaluating the model using a validation set in PyTorch.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def validate_model(model, loader):
    model.eval()
    predictions, actuals = [], []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in loader:
            inputs, labels = batch
            outputs = model(inputs)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            predictions.extend(predicted.numpy())
            actuals.extend(labels.numpy())
    accuracy = accuracy_score(actuals, predictions)
    print(f'Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

- **JavaScript Example:** Model evaluation using TensorFlow.js.

```javascript
async function evaluateModel(model, validationData) {
    const results = await model.evaluate(tf.tensor(validationData.inputs), tf.tensor(validationData.labels));
    console.log(`Validation Accuracy: ${results.acc}`);
}
```

## Key Concepts and Components

### 1. Prompt Templates

**PromptTemplate**:

- **Definition**: A class used to manage and structure prompts, ensuring consistency and reusability.
- **Purpose**: Helps in creating standardized prompts that can be reused across different parts of an application.
- **Components**:

    - **Template**: The core structure of the prompt, often including placeholders for dynamic data.
    - **Inputs**: The variables or data points that will be filled into the placeholders in the template.
  
- **Examples**:

  # Python Example
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

  # Define a prompt template
  prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
      template="You are an expert assistant. Answer the following question in detail:\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:",
      input_variables=["question"],
  )

  ```

  ```js
  // JavaScript Example
  import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts"

  // Define a prompt template
  const promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate({
    template: "You are an expert assistant. Answer the following question in detail:\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:",
    inputVariables: ["question"],
  })
 
  ```

### 2. Chains

**Chains**:

- **Definition**: Sequences of operations where the output of one step serves as the input for the next.
- **Types**:

    - **Simple Chains**: Involve a single call to a language model.
    - **Complex Chains**: Involve multiple steps and can include logic and decision-making.

- **Components**:
  
    - **Links**: Individual steps or operations in the chain.
    - **Flow Control**: Logic that dictates the order and conditions under which steps are executed.

- **Examples**: A chain that first translates text and then summarizes it.


  ```python
  # Python Example
  from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain.chains import LLMChain

  # Initialize the OpenAI model
  chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=your_openai_api_key)

  llm_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=chat_model,
    prompt=prompt_template
  )

  # Create a chain with the model and the prompt template (previous example)
  llm_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=chat_model,
    prompt=prompt_template
  )

  # Define the user's question
  question = "What are the key benefits of using blockchain technology in supply chain management?"

  # Generate a response using the chain
  response = llm_chain.invoke({"question": question})

  print(response["text"])


  ```

  ```js
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
  import { LLMChain } from "langchain/chains";

  // Initialize the OpenAI model
  const chatModel = new ChatOpenAI({
    openAIApiKey: yourOpenAIApiKey,
  });

  // Create a chain with the model and the prompt template (previous example)

  def greet(name):
      return f"Hello, {name}!"

  # Wrap the function in a Tool
  greet_tool = Tool(
      name="greet",
      func=greet,
      description="Greets the user with their name. Use this tool when the input starts with 'greet <name>'."
  )

  # Load tools (in this case, only the greet tool)
  tools = [greet_tool]

  # Initialize the agent with the chat model and the tools
  agent = initialize_agent(
      tools=tools,
      llm=chat_model,
      agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
      verbose=True
  )

  # Define the user input
  input_text = "greet John"

  # Use the agent to process the input and perform actions
  response = agent.run(input_text)

  # Print the response
  print("Agent Response:")
  print(response)

  ```


  ```js
  // JavaScript Example
  import { LLMChain } from "langchain/chains";
  import { AgentExecutor } from "langchain/agents"
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

  // Load environment variables from .env file
  dotenv.config();

  // Initialize the OpenAI model
  const chatModel = new ChatOpenAI({
    openAIApiKey: yourOpenAIApiKey,
  });

  // Define a simple function to be triggered by the agent
  function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }

  // Define a prompt template for decision making
  const promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate({
    inputVariables: ['input'],
    template: 'You are a smart assistant. Decide whether to greet the user based on the input. If the input starts with "greet", call the greet function with the user\'s name. Otherwise, respond with a polite message.\n\nInput: {input}',
  });

  // Create a chain with the model and the prompt template
  const decisionChain = new LLMChain({
    llm: chatModel,
    prompt: promptTemplate,
  });

  // Define the input
  const inputText = 'greet John';

  // Use the decision chain to process the input and get a decision
  decisionChain.invoke({ input: inputText }).then((decisionResponse) => {
    const decision = decisionResponse.text.trim();

    if (decision.toLowerCase().includes('greet')) {
      const name = inputText.split(' ')[1];
      const result = greet(name);
      console.log('Result:');
      console.log(result);
    } else {
      console.log('Response:');
      console.log(decision);
    }
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error generating decision:', error);
  });

  ```

### 4. Memory

# best-practices

# Requirements best practices

1. **Focus on User Needs and Pain Points**: User stories should be centered around the needs, goals, and experiences of the end-users. Consider not only the positive outcomes but also potential pain points or challenges users may encounter.

2. **Use the "As a... I want to... So that..." Format**: Follow the standard user story format, which consists of three parts: the role of the user ("As a..."), the action or functionality they want ("I want to..."), and the reason or benefit for wanting it ("So that..."). This format helps maintain clarity and context for both positive and negative scenarios.

3. **Keep Stories Independent and Atomic**: Each user story should represent a single, independent unit of functionality that can be implemented and delivered separately. Include both positive and negative scenarios within a single user story when applicable, ensuring completeness and comprehensiveness.

4. **Write Stories from the User's Perspective**: Frame user stories in terms of what the user wants to accomplish or achieve. Include negative scenarios that highlight potential errors, difficulties, or unexpected behavior users may encounter during their interactions with the system.

5. **Include Acceptance Criteria for Positive and Negative Scenarios**: Clearly define acceptance criteria for each user story to outline the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete and ready for delivery. Specify acceptance criteria for both positive outcomes and negative scenarios, ensuring that the system behaves appropriately in error conditions.

6. **Estimate Story Size and Complexity**: Use story points or other estimation techniques to estimate the size and complexity of each user story relative to others. Consider the impact of both positive and negative scenarios on the overall complexity of the story when estimating.

7. **Collaborate with Stakeholders**: Involve stakeholders, including users, product owners, developers, and testers, in the process of creating user stories. Collaborative refinement sessions can help identify both positive and negative scenarios, ensuring that user stories are well-defined, feasible, and aligned with project objectives.

8. **Prioritize Mitigation of Negative Scenarios**: Prioritize user stories and tasks related to handling negative scenarios to ensure that they receive appropriate attention during development. Addressing potential error conditions early in the development process helps mitigate risks and improve the overall reliability of the system.

9. **Test Positive and Negative Scenarios During Validation**: During user story validation and testing, include test cases that cover both positive and negative scenarios to verify that the system behaves as expected in all conditions. This ensures that the system provides a positive user experience and handles errors gracefully.

10. **Iteratively Refine and Improve Error Handling**: Continuously refine and improve error handling based on feedback from testing and real-world usage. Use insights from user feedback, error logs, and monitoring to identify and address recurring issues or pain points encountered by users.
